{"title": "Eric Schmidt Thinks This Is The Best Age To Start Measuring Excellence", "transcript": "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, Nov. 29. To receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)\n\nEric Schmidt wants to see new leaders running the world, fast. \u201cThe sooner we can get the next generation in charge, given all the errors we have made, the better,\u201d says Schmidt, the former CEO of Google. \u201cThey are generally smarter, more optimistic, they have more energy. There\u2019s a lot of reasons to turn this thing over to them.\u201d\n\nBut just not any kids. Schmidt is a firm believer in the power of exceptionalism. On Nov. 16 Schmidt Futures, the organization that he founded in 2017 with his wife Wendy to empower \u201ctalent who want to work on the hardest problems,\u201d unveiled Rise, a new partnership with the Rhodes Trust to scour the globe for the world\u2019s most outstanding teenagers and to support them \u201cthrough life\u201d as they use their talents to build a better world. Applications are now being reviewed, and the initial class of 100 will be announced in July 2021.\n\nSchmidt is busy writing his post-Google chapter. He\u2019s chairman of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s Reimagine NY commission, which is focusing on ways for the state to re-emerge from the pandemic. He recently completed a four-year stint advising the U.S. Department of Defense, and he was a big supporter of President-elect Joe Biden; his name has been floated for possible roles in the Administration.\n\nSchmidt, 65, recently joined TIME for a video conversation on why 15 is a special age, how to start fixing social media, and why fears of killer robots are overblown.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\n(This interview with Eric Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Futures, has been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nRise is on the hunt for the world\u2019s most promising teenagers. Why that age cohort?\n\nThe question was, what\u2019s the lowest age at which we can get a signal for excellence? And all of the anecdotal claims are it\u2019s around 16. We\u2019ll see if it\u2019s true or not, but the claim is that you can tell through a series of tests and challenges and so forth who the really exceptional people will be. And exceptional here doesn\u2019t mean just math, it means sort of creativity, verbal skills, sort of the kind of skills that are correlative with great impact.\n\nSo 15 or so is the magic number?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of people who believe that the signal below 15 or 16 is unreliable. There\u2019s lots of 12-year-olds who are super impressive, but the consensus is that it\u2019s 16.\n\nMaybe a side benefit of this project is that parents can calm down a bit about whether their 2-year-old is showing signs of exceptionalism.\n\nWe\u2019re now in a situation where parents are in combat for their children. There\u2019s lots of evidence that children grow up just fine on their own, but the reason Rise is interesting is that there\u2019s plenty of talent programs, but there\u2019s no global one.\n\nYou\u2019ve partnered with groups like the African Leadership Group and the Latin American Leadership Academy to help find young people in refugee camps or who might otherwise slip through the cracks. How much value does the network of local partners add?\n\nI am reasonably convinced that the United States is seeing the top talent within the U.S., and I\u2019m very convinced that we\u2019re not seeing the top talent from the rest of the world. The phrase we use is that talent is distributed universally, but opportunity is not. So the idea is especially for countries where we don\u2019t really know very much, you find the local partners who care a lot about this, and they become your referral network.\n\nHow does the initial batch of 100 kids get chosen?\n\nThe system is designed so that an individual can nominate themselves, but you can also have someone else nominate you. And I personally prefer the latter, because it provides some signaling into the system. But part of our thesis is that there\u2019s people sitting in Afghanistan who are the next Einsteins, who if we can get a phone to them we can communicate with them and we can identify them. And eventually get them out of Afghanistan and into sort of becoming a research scientist or a great musician or whatever it is.\n\nMy original idea was let\u2019s do it fully digital. But a lot of people looked at this and said you cannot do a fully digital selection system because there will be gaming of the system. So you have to do it in two steps. You have a digital system which needs to be on the phone: there\u2019s an app that we just released, which is essentially a series of challenges that you have to work through.\n\nAnd we ask you to produce a video of yourself doing something that you\u2019re interested in. So we think that\u2019s sort of hard to game. We figure in between the test and that, that\u2019s kind of a good funnel.\n\nAre you worried about this making the rounds at Dalton or Hotchkiss?\n\nNo, we have not seen any need to do any filtering so far. I mean, look, if it comes back and it\u2019s rich white kids in the upper Northeast, then we\u2019ve got a problem. Let\u2019s say that no one from Afghanistan submits, well, that would be evidence that we did something wrong.\n\nA philosophical question. You\u2019ve had an exceptional life, you surround yourself with exceptional people. And you\u2019re investing in developing the next generation of exceptional leaders. But is there an argument for focusing on making just the average person\u2019s life a little bit better through public schools and health care?\n\nYeah, and I agree with that. And the question is the mechanism. And what I concluded was that the progress in the United States is driven by these exceptional people. And the American Dream is precisely that somebody that comes out of Appalachia becomes this. I grew up in rural Virginia, so I\u2019m an example of that. And I carry those values with me. Most of the people that I deal with today came from modest backgrounds and had exceptional talent and exceptional luck. So it would be easy to take the money that I made out of Google and just paper it through the schools. And that would be a good thing. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as highly leveraged, and I\u2019m all about leverage.\n\nAre you familiar with the book Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World?\n\nIt\u2019s been described to me, I\u2019ve not read it. I think that there\u2019s plenty of examples to prove the thesis of the book, and there\u2019s plenty of examples to disprove the thesis. If you look at it mathematically, the American Dream is in trouble because mobility between cities and so forth is much lower; dynamism is much lower; patrimonialism, which is where your family does well, is increasing. The fact of the matter is that if you look over the last decade, the average person on average has not done better. And the elite, obviously including myself, have done super well. And I think, I personally think the pandemic is gonna make that much, much worse.\n\nOne of the arguments of the book is that people like yourself use philanthropy to alleviate social pressure but also shape change in a way that will continue to benefit themselves.\n\nThat is certainly not my goal. What have I done in my career? The democratization of phones and the access to information. I basically networked the world and got information in everyone\u2019s hands. I defy you to argue against making the average person smarter. That\u2019s presumably a nonelitist strategy, right? And I would further say that if you look at the philanthropists in the \u201860s, Rockefeller and those guys, they were generally hated. But the institutions that they left have had great value to society.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has questioned the morality of an economic system that produces billionaires, and one of her early advisers popularized the slogan \u201cEvery billionaire is a policy failure.\u201d What is your response?\n\nWe would probably all be better off spending more time understanding the contributions made by specific individuals and not making generalizations about anyone.\n\nDo you also know the quote, attributed to Balzac, \u201cBehind every great fortune there\u2019s a great crime\u201d?\n\nThat may have been true during his time. But the vast majority of my friends are not going to jail. Although I must say there\u2019s a few who have.\n\nWho are you thinking of?\n\nLet me not name anyone. But my important point is, look, you can complain about the tech industry all you want, but the tech industry, as compared to other industries, it is one of the cleanest and most responsible in terms of \u2026 Look at other industries in terms of payoffs and influence peddling, and destruction of the earth. The tech industry is generally socially conscious. You may disagree with our social consciousness, but it\u2019s endemic in the society. When Larry [Page] and Sergey [Brin] started Google, they were concerned about climate change 20 years ago.\n\nIn regard to great crimes, I was actually in this instance thinking about your partner the Rhodes Trust: Cecil Rhodes is a hall of fame colonialist, imperialist and white supremacist. Did that give you any pause in partnering with them on Rise?\n\nNo, no, and because I understand the context of history. The fact that George Washington had slaves does not mean that I revere him less. I just don\u2019t like the fact that he had slaves.\n\nTell me about your notion of risk transfer and how that applies to your philanthropic thinking.\n\nMy wife Wendy and I are doing this together, and she has made the argument that I think is correct that the combination of political correctness, government caution and business conservatism make it harder to take hard risks. And that private philanthropists should be willing to take much bigger risks and suffer the failure. All real progress comes from taking risks, right? And everyone says they want to take risks, but they don\u2019t. But there\u2019s a small number of people who are willing to really bet the farm. And if I can find them, I\u2019m gonna fund them.\n\nBeyond your philanthropy, are there any venture investments that you\u2019re particularly excited about?\n\nI\u2019m very interested in synthetic biology. I\u2019d rather not go into the specifics. We\u2019ve done a lot of stuff around food and vertical farming, the future of food, the future of transportation, the future of biology.\n\nDo you think the current publicly traded companies\u2014the Impossible Foods, the Beyond Meats\u2014are pursuing the right path?\n\nThey are, they are. They really have done a good job. And I think they show the way. And it\u2019s really hard to break into a very mature industry without a different angle, and I think they\u2019ve got it. Most people think with food we\u2019ll get to the point where we can grow the meat\u2014it\u2019s real meat, it\u2019s not fake meat. But we can grow it without having to kill a cow. And I think you know that cows are a large contributor to global warming.\n\nThe phrase we use is that talent is distributed universally, but opportunity is not. - Eric Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Futures\n\nYour four-year term as chairman of the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense Innovation Board recently ended. What was your focus there?\n\nWe did a lot of things. The military is incredibly, incredibly impressive, and it also has incredibly terrible systems. The hardware and the software are from the 1980s. So we set out to try to modernize that with lots of things. I\u2019ll give you an example. The F-35 joint strike fighter was designed in 2001. It\u2019s being deployed now at scale. The computers and the systems were all designed in the early 2000s. Think about that. So I worry that there\u2019s an opportunity gap between what we could do and what we are doing.\n\nComputers from the 2000s?\n\nIt\u2019s complicated, and there\u2019s a very long set of reasons. But we should be able to do that better. And in the case of the weapon systems, the vast majority of the cost is in the lifetime of the system. And so getting that right would save a trillion dollars. It\u2019s a very large amount of money to the nation.\n\nWhat was your most significant accomplishment there?\n\nProbably the most important thing we did is our actions led to the creation of a joint AI center, which will be the place where all the AI work is done. The work is classified, but what the military will talk in general terms about is trying to use AI vision to watch instead of having a human watch. They use the systems to improve their targeting, their understanding of information, that kind of thing.\n\nAs you survey threats, drone strikes, bioterror, small dirty bombs, cyberattacks, do you worry about all of them or one in particular?\n\nThe military generally is concerned about China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and extremist terrorism. That\u2019s generally their list. And you can debate what the order is, but that\u2019s generally what they\u2019re worried about.\n\nDo you worry about swarms of armed drones from China, or is that science fiction?\n\nNo, that\u2019s a likely attack scenario from China. There are science fiction [scenarios], and they\u2019re basically autonomous collections of drones. And because [Chinese drone maker] DGI is 90% of the market, there are reasons to think that they might be leading in that area. There are answers to these, which I won\u2019t discuss. These are all threats. It\u2019s important to understand that the nation is never completely at peace.\n\nShifting gears, you are chairman of Cuomo\u2019s Reimagine NY commission. What have you been focusing on there, and how involved are you?\n\nA lot. So we issued our first set of reports, and our primary message has turned out to be broadband. The stories that we hear about access to broadband, difficulty of online education, especially from the underserved, are really tragic. We need to accelerate access to broadband. Many of these communities, by the way, are not rural. There\u2019s lots of people in New York City who do not have access to broadband who need it for education, for work, for health care. So we, I think the consensus of the commission will be that broadband really needs to be 100% now. Think about it. I mean, how are you gonna get through the pandemic, and are you O.K. with having a whole generation of poor kids not getting educated for a year?\n\nDo you currently engage in any hands-on tech-related activities like hands-on programming? Do you keep your fingers in at all?\n\nSomehow, I\u2019m the tech support for my empire. I spent a lot of time working on network design, fiber-optics design. I\u2019m very, very interested in 5G. I must tell you, I\u2019m not as good a programmer as I was when I was 20.\n\nHow\u2019s your home wi-fi working?\n\nThere\u2019s a new wi-fi called Wi-Fi-6, which I\u2019m busy upgrading everybody to.\n\nIf you look at the philanthropists in the \u201860s, Rockefeller and those guys, they were generally hated. But the institutions that they left have had great value to society. - Eric Schmidt, co-founder of Schmidt Futures\n\nYou\u2019re a huge advocate of the benefits of artificial intelligence. Why do humans find it so scary?\n\nI think AI is overwhelmingly positive. I\u2019m writing a book with [Henry] Kissinger on the future of AI. What I would suggest is that the fears of AI come from the fact that people are watching too many robot movies, where inevitably it\u2019s a female robot who then has a nerdy creator and then the robot kills the creator. That\u2019s a great movie, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re building.\n\nIf you don\u2019t get killed by a beautiful robot, what\u2019s the upside of AI?\n\nThe real AI is going to provide universal language translation, it\u2019s going to provide universal summarization, it\u2019s going to contribute to fantastic understanding across cultures, which is very important. AI will deliver progress in biology and chemistry. Can you imagine if you had materials that were twice as strong, half the price, no carbon emissions, that kind of stuff? All of that\u2019s on its way. And the impact on the pandemic and viruses is without question.\n\nAny concerns about AI?\n\nThe things I worry about\u2014I think mostly about diffusion, because this technology\u2019s gonna be broadly held, and evil people will figure out a way to use it. So for example they\u2019ll make false videos and things like that.\n\nWhat is your view of the government\u2019s current antitrust case against Google and other big technology companies?\n\nI was a CEO during much of the Google activities, and I can assure you there was no violation of antitrust law. If you don\u2019t like what the tech companies are doing, there\u2019s plenty of ways to regulate them. There are institutions that regulate them, whether it\u2019s the Federal Trade Commission or the Federal Communications Commission. Or you can just pass laws. The problem I have with antitrust is it\u2019s an awfully blunt instrument.\n\nWhat would more targeted regulation look like?\n\nSo I\u2019ll pick an example out of Amazon. So Amazon in its stores has a combination of its own brands and advertising and products it sells. It\u2019s confusing to me, as a consumer. That\u2019s an example where maybe we could come to some consensus on how they should be labeled. That\u2019s not an antitrust thing, that\u2019s a regulation.\n\nYou were recently quoted as saying the context of social networks serves as \u201camplifiers for idiots and crazy people.\u201d Was that accurate?\n\nIt\u2019s amazing, it\u2019s truthfully what I said. And the reason I said it is when we built the social networks and social media, we did not intend them to become closed networks of crazy people who are getting their fellow crazy people riled up. That was not the design. The design was sharing experiences, opening up horizons, broadly educating people. And so what seems to have happened is that alarmist messages tend to get people on these networks worried, and then they tend to spread them. And that tends to overwhelm the more normal discourse.\n\nHow might regulation work on social media?\n\nWhen you look at your Twitter feed, how many of the tweets do you see are from bots? Do you know?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nIt should be possible to tell. It would be useful to know. And you can say, \u201cWell, this is a bot. Maybe I want to listen to a human and not a computer.\u201d I want you to have that choice. So what I\u2019m concerned about now is that we\u2019re all reacting to the fact that these systems are organized around sharing of alarmist information. As opposed to broadening the discussion of society and issues around it. And again, the solutions are in the algorithms, not in censorship.\n\nSo there are reports of you being considered for a role in the Biden Administration. What can you say about that?\n\nReally nothing. I\u2019m a huge Biden supporter, I was heavily involved in the election, and I know the people well. But it\u2019s too soon to talk about that. They need to sort out who the Cabinet positions are first.\n\nWhat broad area do you think you could add the most value in?\n\nI\u2019d rather not interview with you for them. But let me tell you that I\u2019m very interested in funding and being involved in American competitiveness. Everything I\u2019ve been talking about is about making America win. I use China as the opponent, but it\u2019s really about I want America to win. America was great to me; I want the next generation to win as well. I don\u2019t want us to lose the seed corn that was so successful on my behalf.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "Black Friday Offers Beacon of Hope to Struggling Stores", "transcript": "NEW YORK \u2014 After months of slumping sales and businesses toppling into bankruptcy, Black Friday is offering a small beacon of hope.\n\nIn normal times, Black Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year, drawing millions of shoppers eager to get started on their holiday spending.\n\nBut these are not normal times: The economy is tanking and crowds are expected to be dramatically diminished as coronavirus cases spike and shoppers do more of their purchases online.\n\nMany retailers closed their doors on Thanksgiving Day but are beefing up their safety protocols to reassure wary customers that they can still come back the next day. For those who can\u2019t be reassured, stores are moving their doorbuster deals online and ramping up curbside pickup options as a last grasp at sales before the year ends and they head into the dark days of winter with the pandemic still raging.\n\n\u201cBlack Friday is still critical,\u201d said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. \u201cNo retailer wants it to be tarnished. It\u2019s still vital to get their consumers spending and get consumers into the holiday mood.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has labeled shopping in crowded stores during the holidays a \u201chigher risk\u201d activity and says people should limit any in-person shopping, including at supermarkets.\n\nInstead, the health agency recommends shopping online, visiting outdoor markets or using curbside pickup, where workers bring orders to you in the parking lot.\n\nThe day after Thanksgiving has been losing its luster as the unofficial start to the holiday shopping season for the past several years, with more stores were offering holiday discounts throughout the month. Still, Black Friday has remained the busiest day of the year, according to ShopperTrak, and is expected to hold that title again this year.\n\nThere is reason for hope. Retailers were successful in convincing shoppers to spend early by pushing big discounts in mid-October. And shoppers have shown their willingness to spend for other holidays like Easter and Halloween.\n\nThe National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, has taken an optimistic view, predicting that shoppers will be looking for reasons to celebrate. The trade group expects sales for the November and December period to increase between 3.6% and 5.2% over 2019 compared with a 4% increase the year before. Holiday sales have averaged gains of 3.5% over the past five years.\n\n\u201cAfter all they\u2019ve been through, we think there\u2019s going to be a psychological factor that they owe it to themselves and their families to have a better-than-normal holiday,\u201d said NRF Chief Economist Jack Kleinhenz. \u201cThere are risks to the economy if the virus continues to spread, but as long as consumers remain confident and upbeat, they will spend for the holiday season.\u201d\n\nOnline sales could realize even bigger gains heading into the holidays. Black Friday is projected to generate $10 billion in online sales, a 39% bump from the year ago period, according to Adobe Analytics, which measures sales at 80 of the top 100 U.S. online retailers. And Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving, will remain the biggest online shopping day of the year with $12.7 billion in sales, a 35% jump.\n\nThe pandemic has already benefited Amazon, which continues to seal its dominance in the online space as jittery shoppers click on their devices instead of venturing into stores. Likewise, big box chains like Walmart and Target that were allowed to stay open during the spring lockdowns fared far better than department stores and other non-essential retailers that were forced to close. That disparity helped speed up bankruptcy filings of more than 40 chains, including J.C. Penney and J.Crew, and resulted in hundreds of stores closings.\n\nPlenty of clothing chains like Abercrombie and Fitch have warned of more difficult days ahead, including the possibility of even more store closures. A&F said Tuesday it expects sales declines to deepen to 5% to 10% for the holiday quarter.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of unknowns as we head into what\u2019s our traditionally highest volume weeks of the year,\u201d Scott Lipesky, chief financial officer at Abercrombie & Fitch told analysts on its earnings call. \u201cWith COVID numbers rising, there is the potential for a change in apparel demand and customer willingness to enter physical stores. \u201c\n\nDepartment stores and other clothing stores that haven\u2019t yet recovered from the closures during the spring will have a hard time making up for lost sales, says Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics LLC , a retail research firm.\n\nFor the fiscal third quarter, mall-based retailers saw their profits down 20% while big box stores and other retailers that operate outside a traditional mall posted a 19% increase, according to RetailMetrics\u2019 tally of roughly 100 retailers. For the fiscal fourth quarter, mall-based retailers are expected to see profits down 31%, while off-mall stores should see profits up 1%.\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "China\u2019s Cainiao Is Revolutionizing How Goods Get Delivered. Will the Rest of the World Follow Its Rules?", "transcript": "It might not be the slickest thing on four wheels, and it definitely won\u2019t win any time trials, but Chinese logistics firm Cainiao\u2019s new Xiao G delivery cart could be the future.\n\nEvery hour, the three-foot by five-foot automated vehicle picks up packages from Cainiao\u2019s depot in Hangzhou\u2014a city of 10 million people in China\u2019s booming east\u2014and tours a nearby neighborhood. Locals in pajamas pop down to meet the driverless cart at their nearest delivery point and type in a reference number. A door in the vehicle\u2019s side pops open and the customer\u2019s parcel can be retrieved. Xiao G heads onto the next stop, weaving ponderously through traffic via 360-degree sensors.\n\n\u201cIt sends a message to customers after setting off and another when it arrives at a pick-up point so they know to come down,\u201d says Cainiao engineer Long Fei. \u201cSome models allow customers to drop off as well as pick up packages.\u201d\n\nIn terms of innovations in logistics, Xiao G may not be as earth-shaking as the shipping container or the cargo jet. But it is the most visible aspect of a stealthy revolution powered by Cainiao, which was founded in 2014 and whose name means \u201crookie\u201d in Chinese. The $10 billion subsidiary of e-commerce behemoth Alibaba says it is poised to transform worldwide trade.\n\nCainiao engineer Long Fei loads packages onto the firm\u2019s Xiao G automated delivery vehicle in Hangzhou, China on Oct. 19, 2020. Charlie Campbell\n\nHow your purchases could be delivered in the future\n\nThe Xiao G is part of Cainiao\u2019s plan to create a single ecosystem for all logistics firms across the world to plug into, allowing for the seamless transfer of goods between companies and jurisdictions. Just as myriad smartphone makers all operate on Google\u2019s Android, Cainiao envisages thousands of independent logistics firms can operate within its system, sharing everything from labeling standards to customs information.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing is bigger than it appears to be,\u201d says Jeffrey Towson, a private-equity investor and a professor of investment at Peking University in Beijing. \u201cIt might be the single most important thing happening in China\u2019s digital space.\u201d\n\nCainiao is far from a typical logistics firm, but is an open platform that allows for collaboration with 3,000 logistics partners and 3 million couriers\u2014including the top 15 delivery firms inside China and 100 operating internationally. This enables merchants to choose the most cost- and time-efficient delivery option, based upon real-time data crunching of optimum firms and routes.\n\nRead more: China\u2019s Delivery Drivers Keep E-Commerce on Track During Coronavirus\n\nFor consumers and manufacturers, this means a typical, 1 kg package can be sent anywhere in China within 24 hours for around 30 cents. The goal is to deliver it anywhere in the world within 72 hours for $3. (Currently, a DHL envelope under 0.5 kg from Shanghai to London costs around $100 and takes typically 5 days.) That stands to be a life-changing boon to coffee-growers in Peru, textile-weavers in Chad, medical instrument producers in Bangalore and everyone in between.\n\n\u201cWe had to get all the CEOs of different delivery companies in a room to work out how to do this,\u201d says Cainiao CEO Wan Lin, sitting in the firm\u2019s Hangzhou headquarters, which is punctuated with gym equipment and pink bunting to celebrate the recent Singles Day shopping extravaganza. \u201cBecause the biggest barrier to globalization is logistics.\u201d\n\nWan Lin, President of Cainiao Network Technology, delivers a speech during the 2019 Global Smart Logistics Summit (GSLS) in Hangzhou, China on May 28, 2019. Wei Zhiyang\u2014Zhejiang Daily/Visual China Group/ Getty Images\n\nHow the COVID-19 pandemic pushed logistics innovation\n\nBy putting sensors in everything\u2014along with cameras in every warehouse and GPS on every truck and package\u2014Cainiao aims to digitize the logistics process from top to bottom.\n\nIn China, the implications are vast for the $1.94 trillion e-commerce sector, currently the world\u2019s largest and three times the size of its U.S. counterpart. Some 64 billion parcels were sent last year domestically but current delivery networks are piecemeal, inefficient and wasteful. Wander any Chinese city or town and it\u2019s common to see gangs of smoking delivery drivers sorting through heaps of crumpled packages on the street. Packaging is also obscenely wasteful: order a 0.1mm protective film for your smartphone screen and you could find it turning up in a shoebox-sized carton packed with air pillows and styrofoam.\n\nSo there\u2019s enormous scope to boost profits, and safeguard the environment, though savings on fuel, packaging and unnecessary storage. E-shipping labels alone save over 400 billion pieces of paper and offset a billion kilograms of carbon emissions annually, according to Cainiao. And then there is the cost. \u201cChina will process 70 billion parcels this year,\u201d says Wan. \u201cWhat if you can shave just one cent off each one?\u201d\n\nWan is used to thinking big. After earning a doctorate at the University of Texas at Austin, he spent nine years at Amazon, eventually reporting directly to Jeff Bezos as director of global logistics strategy. He says Seattle \u201cstill feels like home\u201d and credits Bezos for instilling an ethos of \u201clet\u2019s raise the bar and exceed expectations.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon taught me about customer-centric culture and capability,\u201d says Wan. \u201cCulture without capability is just a slogan on the wall.\u201d\n\nBeing part of Alibaba means that every aspect of Cainiao\u2019s process can be kept in-house. Say a merchant sells internationally on Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce platform Taobao. Transactions can be processed by Alibaba\u2019s payment arm Ant Financial and the goods delivered via Cainiao\u2014all part of one corporate ecosystem. That enables computers to quickly check that every detail matches up\u2014be it cost, vendor, or size and weight of goods dispatched\u2014and feed this information to the necessary customs departments while flagging potential problems. When Cainiao\u2019s charter planes leave the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen for Russia, for example, customs data is sent at take-off and by the time it has landed the cargo has already been cleared.\n\nRead more: Why the U.S. Could Be the Big Loser in the Huge RCEP Trade Deal\n\nWhile consumers and retailers aren\u2019t limited to only using Taobao for orders, or Ant Financial for payment processing, the streamlined customs procedure that results from going closed-loop is a big incentive to do so\u2014boosting shipping times, as well as Alibaba\u2019s bottom line and China\u2019s logistical clout.\n\nThe efficiencies are impressive, according to Wan. \u201cWhen we first started doing cross-border delivery in 2014, a shipment could take one month,\u201d he says. \u201cNow for custom clearance, we process more than 20 million parcels in a single day.\u201d\n\nCainiao\u2019s capability was put to the test during the early days of the pandemic, when delivery routes had to be adjusted to avoid coronavirus hotspots, while ensuring that those same areas received the supplies they needed.\n\nBack in January, Cainiao launched the \u201cGreen Channel\u201d initiative to transport global medical aid to Wuhan, which was plunged into a bruising 76-day lockdown after COVID-19 was first identified in the city. Cainiao directed some 69 million medical relief items from 39 countries and regions to local medical institutions within a single day.\n\nAfter China got a grip on the virus, the firm\u2019s efforts turned outward, boosting flight charters from 260 to a whopping 1,260 to replace cargo capacity lost by slashed passenger services. It helped to deliver 250 million pieces of PPE to more than 150 countries and regions. By stress-testing Cainiao\u2019s systems, the pandemic ended up spurring many of advances.\n\n\u201cCOVID-19 made everyone realize how important the logistics infrastructure backbone is,\u201d says Wan. \u201cAnd it gave us a peek at what Cainiao should look like in three years.\u201d\n\nA staff member arranges boxes of anti-epidemic supplies of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) at Cainiao's Nansha warehouse on in Guangzhou, China on April 29, 2020. Ji Dong\u2014China News Service/Getty Images\n\nThe new technology of parcel delivery\n\n\n\nIn the near-term, having a state-of-the-art logistics system gives Chinese manufacturers a competitive edge to offset rising wages in a rapidly developing society.\n\nBut it\u2019s also a strategic advantage that chimes with Beijing\u2019s China Standards 2035 plan to set global benchmarks for next-generation technologies like 5G, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although China has been making steady gains in this regard\u2014contributing a significant number of protocol standards for 5G wireless networks, for example\u2014Cainiao\u2019s logistics endeavors may be the first time the world\u2019s most populous nation writes truly global rules.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s part of a strategic move to become a technology-driven country, where very good minds try to see what the future is going to look like and contribute to future industries,\u201d says Prof. Dipak Chand Jain, the European president at the China Europe International Business School and formerly dean of Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management.\n\nIt remains to be seen what effect Cainiao will have on the U.S., where an estimated 95% of all e-commerce orders are delivered by Fedex, UPS or the U.S. Postal Service. German-owned DHL, meanwhile, boasts 39% of the global logistics market. Amazon, which until recently provided 10% of all UPS business, has also launched its own delivery arm including flights.\n\nYet while these companies operate competing services, Cainiao has the potential to outflank them because its platform can absorb any industry players that wish to be a part of it. The Chinese firm says it is already partnering with UPS and Fedex on warehousing and some business-to-business logistics. \u201cNowhere in Europe or the U.S. are they attempting anything remotely like this,\u201d says Towson.\n\nRead more: How China Could Emerge Even Stronger After COVID-19\n\nIt\u2019s not just the prestige that comes with being an innovator. China also hankers after the geo-strategic clout that comes with it. \u201cChina wants to be in that same position as the U.S., where its technology becomes indispensable and used all over the world and it can dictate terms about who does and doesn\u2019t get to use it,\u201d says Mark Natkin, founder of Beijing-based IT research firm Marbridge Consulting.\n\nIt\u2019s a strategy that has taken on new significance after the Trump Administration started sanctioning Chinese tech firms and banned telecoms giant Huawei from using U.S. components as well as Google\u2019s Android operating system.\n\nAnd just as Google\u2019s Android has millions of software engineers around the world creating products for it, so Cainiao\u2019s system offers an incentive for builders of apps, logistics infrastructure\u2014and the next generation Xiao G\u2014to create products to that standard, knowing that they can be sold to any of the thousands of firms tied to it.\n\nUltimately, says Towson, the next stage is when smart learning gets injected into the global logistics architecture. \u201cWill these robots move themselves? Will these trucks drive themselves?\u201d asks Towson. \u201cHow smart is this system going to be?\u201d\n\nIn China, it\u2019s already common for robots to deliver food to restaurant tables, or serve as digital concierges in hotel lobbies. Now it\u2019s the turn of the logistics industry to become a testing ground for advances previously only seen in comics and movies. \u201cYes, in some ways life is imitating art,\u201d says Wan. \u201cWe are building that sci-fi future of technological marvels.\u201d\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "World Wide Technology Chairman Dave Steward on Founding the Largest Black-Owned Company in America", "transcript": "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, Nov. 22; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)\n\n\n\nDave Steward is not your typical billionaire tech-company founder. His company is based in St. Louis, not San Jose. He brings his deep faith into the workplace. Earlier this year, he wrote Leadership by the Good Book, with a foreword by Bishop T.D. Jakes, about applying biblical principles to a business setting. He\u2019s a salesman, not a technologist\u2014he was once FedEx\u2019s salesperson of the year.\n\nAnd Steward, 69, is the rare Black chairman in an industry that has struggled with diversity, particularly at senior levels. His privately owned $12 billion company, World Wide Technology (WWT), is thriving in the current COVID-19 environment, helping a broad range of corporations select and install complex computer systems and other digital infrastructure. With more than 5,600 employees and offices around the globe, the company is the largest Black-owned business in America. Steward recently joined TIME for a video conversation on the impact of COVID on his business, why he has chosen to keep WWT private and how his father inspired his entrepreneurial zeal.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\n(This interview with World Wide Technology chairman Dave Steward has been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nIt\u2019s become a truism that the pandemic has accelerated the shift to digitalization by five years. What areas are you seeing have stepped up demand?\n\nCyberattacks have gone up over 100%, so our security practice has skyrocketed. From federal, state and local, to utilities, to health care, every sector has been just hammered with cyberattacks.\n\nSo the bad guys are pivoting to digital too?\n\nIt\u2019s just off the charts.\n\nSo are you adding head count to your cybersecurity team?\n\nWe\u2019re adding employees across the full spectrum of our business, from networks to architecture to engineering. You name it, we\u2019re adding openings. Right now, I think we have 700 openings. We can\u2019t find the right people fast enough.\n\nYour slogan is \u201cExperience Silicon Valley in St. Louis.\u201d Do you have any issues recruiting top tech talent to live in St. Louis?\n\nNo, we haven\u2019t because we\u2019re consistently ranked as one of the best places to work by Fortune and Glassdoor. I will challenge anyone to find a health care plan that we have and benefits plan that we have in place, where we cover the spouse and everybody in the entire family at minimal cost to the employee. And we haven\u2019t increased that cost in 10 years, longer than that, 15 years. But also I think that culture matters, and we have a set of core values that we all believe in and we feel are vitally important and very inclusive.\n\nWhy haven\u2019t you gone public?\n\nThe question is, Why would we? The only shareholder that we\u2019re concerned about is me. And my whole goal and objective is not all about the money, it\u2019s about how we serve our clients better than anybody else. How do we continue to improve, how do we invest in a way that\u2019s long term, that 50 years from now, not a quarter from now. Investors in the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or anywhere else, they\u2019re not very patient.\n\nSo have you turned away a lot of investment bankers over the years? How do you rebuff them?\n\nAs I think about investment bankers, I think about them from the standpoint, How can we make you better as an investment bank? And when you see new technology that you think is something really good, how can we help you make it even more valuable and take the risk out of it?\n\nI heard you were a good salesman! So when you are pitched for an IPO, you turn it around into a sales call for your company?\n\nIt\u2019s a great opportunity.\n\nOne day I asked, 'What business am I in? Am I in the business of auditing freight bills on railroads? Or am I in the business of using technology in a new and innovative way?' - Dave Steward, chairman of World Wide Technology\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about the origin story for your company. Your first business involved stitching together technology to audit freight bills. Was there a moment when you saw how the advent of computing power was going to transform American business?\n\nOne day I asked, \u201cWhat business am I in? Am I in the business of auditing freight bills on railroads? Or am I in the business of using technology in a new and innovative way?\u201d That was the lightbulb moment. I decided that I want to be a part of the technological revolution. So in 1990, I started this company called World Wide Technology with five people and 4,000 square feet.\n\nWas that before or after Al Gore invented the Internet?\n\nThat was before he created the Internet.\n\nToday it\u2019s a $12 billion company, but in your book, you describe some dark days early on, when there was an embezzlement.\n\nI don\u2019t put it that way. Some money was reallocated.\n\nReallocated into a personal pocket?\n\nYeah, a personal pocket.\n\nWas the company at risk? Was it a significant amount of the capital at that time?\n\nYes, it was. I had my car repossessed from the company parking lot. I had to go out there and get my briefcase out of the car like nothing happened.\n\nWhile growing up in Clinton, Mo., I understand that you got a lot of your entrepreneurial drive from your father.\n\nEntrepreneurial zeal from my father, and such encouragement from my mother.\n\nYou describe your father as quite an accomplished jack-of-all-trades.\n\nHe was, out of necessity. He was a master mechanic, he was a bartender, he was a hunter, he was a security guard. You name it. He cleaned offices; he had a janitorial service. Because of racism, because of bigotry, because of segregation and all those things \u2026 He was the first entrepreneur I ever saw. So I wanted to be like my dad. And my mom was the epitome of optimism and encouragement, and always encouraging us that we were special.\n\nInnovation doesn\u2019t happen without a person of color or a diversity of thought being at the table in order to challenge the status quo. - Dave Steward, chairman of World Wide Technology\n\nWhat was your childhood like?\n\nI was born in 1951. I graduated from high school in \u201969. So you think about during that period of time, Brown v. Board of Education, I\u2019m going into the first grade and they\u2019re saying we\u2019re gonna integrate the school system, and the Ku Klux Klan said no way that\u2019s going to happen. And so my dad had to patrol the town all night to ensure that his five children had the time to go to school safely. He put himself really at risk. But I think they probably were more afraid of him because he was 6 ft. 4 in. and 240 lb., with a mean attitude.\n\nWhat was your household like?\n\nWe didn\u2019t have an indoor bathroom until I was 8 or 9. We had a dip bucket with water in it, and we had a slop bucket. It was a chore for me to take it out every day. I didn\u2019t know that we were so poor until later on in life.\n\nDid you face much discrimination growing up in Clinton?\n\nThere was adversity and challenges. It was a very, very difficult time. The one movie theater we couldn\u2019t go to, the other one we had to sit in the balcony. We couldn\u2019t go roller-skating. We couldn\u2019t also go to the swimming pool.\n\nIs there one event that sticks in your craw?\n\nI was 8 years old, and they said I couldn\u2019t join the Boy Scouts. And my mother had to tell me.\n\nWhat was that conversation like?\n\nIn order to get through that, you have to have blinders on. I remember this, we cried together. [Steward teared up recalling the incident.]\n\nI have the Silver Buffalo Award, which is the highest honor that you can get with the Boy Scouts. Now you think about the hurt and pain of that, and the power of forgiveness and all of that, and I could have easily been bitter about that my entire life. So that\u2019s what my parents taught me, the power of forgiveness. And here we are, I think 700 people in the world have the Silver Buffalo Award.\n\nHow is the country doing today in terms of race relations?\n\nWe have our problems, but we live in the greatest country in the history of the world. It used to be where you could not get past that caste system. It used to be that we had to live on the other side of the tracks But there\u2019s an obligation as well for us, persons of color, not to allow that to be a distraction. There are unique gifts that we bring to America and bring to the relationships and the growing and developing and understanding and a common ground. We have something in common. We all love this country, and we all have something to contribute in a unique way. Innovation doesn\u2019t happen without a person of color or a diversity of thought being at the table in order to challenge the status quo.\n\nSTEWARD\u2019S FAVORITES\n\nBOOK: My Bible.\n\nAPP: I\u2019m always looking at new Scripture and getting the deep meaning of that Scripture. There\u2019s a number of pastors that I read their materials.\n\nEXERCISE: I\u2019m on this regimen of getting up every morning and doing some stretches and doing some exercise. I used to do 100 consecutive push-ups every morning. That started hurting my shoulder, so I\u2019ve cut that down to only 30. After lunch, I\u2019ve got this routine. I walk kind of fast; I\u2019ve got these hills that I do for about 25 minutes.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "Airbnb Details Years of Losses Ahead of a Planned IPO", "transcript": "Airbnb was losing money even before the pandemic struck and cut its revenue by almost a third, the home-sharing company revealed in documents filed Monday ahead of a planned initial public offering of its stock.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company has yet to set a date for the IPO but it is laying the groundwork by filing financial records with U.S. securities regulators.\n\nThe documents show that leading up to the coronavirus outbreak earlier this year, Airbnb was spending heavily on technology and marketing to grow its business. The company said it was expanding its operations and adding new programs, like tours and other experiences that travelers could book through its website.\n\nIts revenue jumped 32% to $4.8 billion in 2019, but it reported a net loss of $674 million that year. The company also lost money in 2018 and 2017.\n\nThis year, Airbnb said, revenue fell 32% to $2.5 billion in the first nine months as travelers canceled their plans after the pandemic crippled travel and forced lockdowns around the world.\n\nThe pandemic forced a financial reckoning, the company said. In May, Airbnb cut 1,900 employees, or around 25% of its workforce, and slashed investments in programs, like movie production, not related to its core business.\n\nAirbnb funded operations with $2 billion from various sources, including a $1 billion investment from private equity firms Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners.\n\nNow, the company said, demand is rebounding as some travelers see home rentals as safer than crowded hotels. The number of nights and experiences booked, which plummeted more than 100% in March and April, were down 28% in July, August and September.\n\nAirbnb said that indicates its business model is resilient and can adapt to future travel needs, including an increase in business travelers who want to work from a rental home.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the lines between travel and living are blurring, and the global pandemic has accelerated the ability to live anywhere,\u201d the company said.\n\nAirbnb said it currently has 7.4 million listings run by 4 million hosts worldwide. Eighty-six percent of its hosts are outside the U.S. and 55% are women, the company said.\n\nThe company said it had 54 million guests in 2019.\n\nAirbnb was founded 12 years ago by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia \u2014 classmates at the Rhode Island School of Design \u2014 and Nate Blecharczyk, a software engineer. Their first listing was Chesky and Gebbia\u2019s apartment in San Francisco.\n\nChesky, Airbnb\u2019s CEO, will receive a multi-year equity grant worth an estimated $120 million in lieu of a salary, the company said. The award will vest if he meets stock-price targets over the next decade.\n\nAirbnb\u2019s massive growth hasn\u2019t been without complications.\n\nThe company has angered some cities that accuse it of promoting overtourism and making neighborhoods less affordable by taking housing off the market. Cities like Los Angeles, Barcelona, Paris and even Airbnb\u2019s home city of San Francisco have passed laws restricting its rentals.\n\nThe company has tried to clean up its couch-surfing reputation by adding luxury rentals and promising to verify each of its properties to make sure the photos on its website match the accommodations.\n\nIt has also been cracking down on parties since a 2019 shooting at an illegal Airbnb house party in California. The shooting left five people dead.\n\nIn the meantime, relationships with its hosts have sometimes frayed. Earlier this year, hosts were infuriated when Airbnb allowed guests to cancel and get full refunds amid the pandemic. Airbnb later promised $250 million to hosts to make up the shortfall.\n\nMore recently, the company said it will set aside 9.2 million shares for a host endowment, which will fund projects for hosts when its value tops $1 billion. It also named a 15-member host advisory committee to distribute those funds and meet regularly with Airbnb leadership.\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "Dow Jones Sets New Record After Promising COVID-19 Vaccine News", "transcript": "NEW YORK \u2014 The Dow Jones Industrial Average returned to a record Monday for the first time since plunging nine months ago in despair about the pandemic, riding a swell of optimism that a vaccine may soon control the coronavirus and the economic destruction it\u2019s caused.\n\nModerna said early in the morning that its COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective, according to preliminary data. It\u2019s the second time this month that a company unveiled such encouraging numbers about a vaccine, boosting hopes that the global economy can return to some semblance of normal next year.\n\nLeading the way again were stocks of companies that would benefit most from an economy busting out of its forced hibernation, such as airlines, movie theaters and banks. At the same time, pandemic-winning stocks that benefited from lockdown orders like Amazon and Zoom Video Communications lagged as they no longer looked like the only safe bets to play.\n\nThe Dow jumped 470.63 points, or 1.6%, to 29,950.44. It surpassed its prior closing record of 29,551.42, set in February before pandemic panic hit the market.\n\nThe S&P 500, which matters more to the performance of most 401(k) accounts, added to its own record set on Friday. It rose 41.76, or 1.2%, to 3,626.91. The Nasdaq composite gained 94.84, or 0.8%, to 11,924.13. It lagged the rest of the market amid lessened interest for tech stocks.\n\nTreasury yields, oil prices and stocks around the world also rallied on the shot of increased optimism. A vaccine is precisely what markets have been waiting for to pull the global economy out of its cavern, and analysts say it\u2019s a game changer.\n\nOf course, for all its euphoria, many risks remain for the market. It\u2019s still not guaranteed when a vaccine could be widely available, let alone whether one ultimately will. The pandemic is continuing to worsen, meanwhile, with rising coronavirus counts across the United States and Europe pushing governments to bring back varying degrees of restrictions on businesses. Some areas of the economy have been slowing, particularly after big financial-support programs from Congress expired.\n\n\u201cThe vaccine could help people breathe a sigh of relief, but the devil is in the details,\u201d said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, referring to the need for more complete data and a eventual distribution plans.\n\nBut investors for now are focusing on the possibility of a world next year where customers are again going outside to work at offices, buying things at enclosed stores and heading on vacations.\n\nIt was just a week ago that Pfizer and BioNTech sent optimism soaring with their encouraging vaccine data results. Movie-theater chain Cinemark has surged 58.3% since just before the announcement. Stocks of smaller companies, whose prices tend to sway more with the strength of the economy, are up more than double their larger rivals over the same time: an 8.6% jump for the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks versus 3.5% for the S&P 500.\n\nStocks of companies that had thrived amid lockdowns and vigilance about the virus, meanwhile, have lagged. Amazon, Netflix and Etsy are all down more than 5% since just before Pfizer\u2019s announcement. Zoom has sunk 20.2%.\n\nThe shift in market sentiment is perhaps most clear in the stock prices of Peloton, with its at-home exercise bikes, and the Planet Fitness chain of gyms. Peloton is down 18.8% since Nov. 6, versus a gain of more than 5.7% for Planet Fitness.\n\nInvestors aren\u2019t abandoning Big Tech amid the vaccine hopes. But the ability of Apple, Microsoft and other behemoths to stand so clearly apart from the rest of the market has diminished a bit. That has many money managers pulling some of the big profits made on Big Tech and steering them into beaten-down areas of the market.\n\nOf course, such movements could limit the gains for broad index funds. Stocks with bigger market values hold bigger sway on the S&P 500 and other indexes, which means any slowdown for Big Tech could diminish movements for the funds at the center of many 401(k) accounts, even if the rest of the market is rising.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s sometimes what happens when you get a rotation, especially into the smaller stocks,\u201d said Barry James, portfolio manager with James Investment Research. \u201cYou don\u2019t see it. It\u2019s almost invisible.\u201d\n\nEven before Moderna\u2019s vaccine news, markets had been trading higher as investors welcomed the signing on Sunday of an agreement establishing the world\u2019s biggest trade bloc, a group of 15 countries that includes China, Japan, South Korea, 10 countries in Southeast Asia, New Zealand and Australia. The United States, the No. 1 economy, is not a part of it.\n\nCalled the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the pact mostly will bring already low tariffs lower over a 20-year period. It is expected to have a positive but incremental impact on trade in the region.\n\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 rose 2.1%, South Korea\u2019s Kospi gained 2% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng added 0.9%.

{"title": "Jim Fish, CEO of Waste Management, on How the Pandemic Changed Garbage", "transcript": "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, Nov. 15; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)\n\nArchaeologists and private eyes have long known that sifting through trash can yield juicy revelations. As the nation\u2019s leading garbage collector, Waste Management has a unique vantage point into what\u2019s going on in the country\u2019s homes and businesses. As people quarantine\u2014and eat more\u2014in their homes, residential garbage bins are heavier; cardboard from all those Amazon boxes is filling the recycling stream. The company\u2019s pickups at concert venues and stadiums, however, have largely dried up. Cardboard cutouts of fans don\u2019t create trash.\n\nThe $15.5 billion company is also the biggest residential recycler in North America and the largest operator of landfills in the country. The waste business is capital-intensive and increasingly driven by technology and innovation. Waste Management has invested almost $600 million in startups and companies with next-generation approaches to throwing things away. The company has made dozens of investments in companies, some trying to turn plastic back into crude oil or cardboard into ethanol. Others deal with hazardous waste, medical waste or waste conversion. \u201cThere are a bunch of different investments that we\u2019ve made, probably upwards of 50 different companies over a decade,\u201d says Waste Management CEO Jim Fish. One of Fish\u2019s most promising bets is on a company that turns junk mail into roofing board for big commercial buildings.\n\nSome of the innovation is lower tech but equally transformative. For the past 15 years, the industry has been moving increasingly to side-loader trucks, which mechanically dump the large plastic green and blue curbside containers into garbage trucks. That shift has cut down on injuries and labor costs. \u201cAnd by the way, it makes it easier to hire a driver,\u201d says Fish. \u201cIf I told you, \u2018Look, your job is to get out of the truck every 20 feet and dump a trash can in the back of an old-style rear-loader as opposed to running a joystick sitting in a truck,\u2019 I think I can tell you which one you and I would choose.\u201d\n\nFish, 58, recently joined TIME for a video conversation on how the pandemic changed what people throw out, who are the best recyclers, the surprising complexity of landfills and why people think bowling balls are recyclable (they are not).\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\n(This interview with Waste Management CEO Jim Fish has been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nWhat does America\u2019s current garbage output tell us now about the state of the economy?\n\nWe are a pretty good barometer for the overall economy because we service every different sector. What we\u2019re really seeing is that particularly in those places that opened more quickly than others, their economies have come back more quickly.\n\nAny sectors where trash output is still way down?\n\nThe hospitality space is the one standout, whether it\u2019s airlines and airports, hotels, theaters.\n\nWith people at home more, what is the impact on your residential business?\n\nThe weight per container went way up\u2014almost 25% at the depths of COVID. On a normal basis, you might be going into your office or you\u2019re going into restaurants. Now you\u2019re eating everything at home. Everything you do is at home. All the waste that you might have put in your wastebasket or your recycle bin at work is all going into your home containers. It\u2019s not up 25% anymore. It\u2019s single digits now.\n\nWhat does the residential waste stream tell us about changes in consumer behavior?\n\nWhat we\u2019ve seen is an acceleration of a trend that was already taking place, which was this move to Amazon [and other online retailers]. That was taking place before COVID, but boy, it really rapidly accelerated within a COVID environment. Every day I see a dozen UPS and FedEx trucks and Amazon trucks running around the neighborhood. And they\u2019re dropping off 10 packages at every house. That might have been two packages at every house pre-COVID, and now it\u2019s 10.\n\nSo how does that impact what people throw away?\n\nThe impact on our business is cardboard in our recycle stream. It\u2019s coming from a different place. Instead of coming from a Sears store, which we might have picked up before, now it\u2019s coming in small quantities from residential customers as opposed to big commercial customers. One question that I have asked and I haven\u2019t gotten a good answer to internally is, \u2018So is it more cardboard that\u2019s being created?\u2019 If you think about it, all of those 10 boxes that come to our house, I think there\u2019s more cardboard being used than one big box going to a Sears. I don\u2019t know for a fact, but I suspect that all these individual boxes actually add up to more cardboard. So it\u2019s more and more important that we be a good recycler of old corrugated cardboard. [After the interview, Waste Management provided the following answer to the question that Fish posed: Cardboard has increased in the residential stream\u2014about 15% to 20% over the past few years, and recently with COVID we have seen increases in cardboard and additional bottles and cans. So while cardboard has increased on a percentage basis, overall recycling volumes are down about 4% to 5% on the year when looking at commercial and residential volumes.]\n\nI think most Americans think that a landfill is kind of the old-style dump, where all you do is just throw it into a hole. There is a lot of complexity that people just simply don\u2019t appreciate. - Waste Management CEO Jim Fish\n\nBased on what you are seeing in terms of what people are throwing away, what do you think will be the most lasting change in consumer behavior to come out of the pandemic?\n\nI honestly believe that the shift back toward single-use plastics has been a temporary, COVID-19 shift. Ultimately, when the world gets back to normal, we will again move toward fewer single-use items and more reusable ones.\n\nAs a result of the pandemic, by some estimates, state and local government revenues will decline $155 billion in 2020. How will that impact you?\n\nWe have a lot of big cities that are customers of ours, and I suspect that in many, many cases, those cities are going to be under pressure. Their tax revenues are going to be down. So while it hasn\u2019t affected us yet, it probably will as we go back to the negotiating table and look to recover some of this increase in container waste that we just talked about. It\u2019s a tough conversation for us with those municipalities because they\u2019re coming at it from a budget-shortfall standpoint. We\u2019re coming at it from a lowest-margin standpoint, and the two are going to collide.\n\nDoes that mean that garbage pickup will be cut back?\n\nI think they\u2019re going to come at it probably as much as anything from a price standpoint as opposed to a frequency standpoint, because really it becomes a public-health issue. When you start to talk about reducing frequency or eliminating pickups, I mean that becomes a real public-health problem.\n\nWith 249 landfills, you are North America\u2019s biggest operator of landfills. What does it take to run a landfill these days?\n\nI think most Americans think that a landfill is kind of the old-style dump, where all you do is just throw it into a hole. There is a lot of complexity that people just simply don\u2019t appreciate. Our landfills are almost like engineered assets. There is a tremendous amount of cost, capital expenditure required now to construct a landfill.\n\nWhat are the different factors that come to play?\n\nPart of the complexity is that we have GPS on our heavy equipment, and it helps us to determine the compaction levels. How compacted do you want that landfill to be? You have to be very careful about how steep the slope is in a landfill. You don\u2019t want to have a slide. Probably the most complex thing we do in our landfills is the collection of gas. We capture the gas that comes from the decomposition of trash. At over 100 of our landfills, we have gas-collection plants. So we collect the gas in all of our landfills, and then at over 100 of them, we turn it into renewable energy. That is truly a complex process. You have to determine how many wells you\u2019re going to sink, at what depth you\u2019re going to sink those wells. And then we have to buy the generators to convert that gas. With renewable natural gas, we clean that gas up before we turn it into pipeline-quality gas.\n\nDo you sell that gas, is that a profit center for you?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nHow do you protect the environment?\n\nWe have triple-lined landfills. So whether it\u2019s a geosynthetic lining and then a clay lining and then another geosynthetic lining, we capture all of the water that seeps into the landfill. We capture that and treat that water. There isn\u2019t anything escaping those landfills. We make absolutely certain of that.\n\nLet\u2019s move on to recycling. Can you give us a brief summary of what China did and how that impacted the recycling business?\n\nChina announced they\u2019re fully shutting down the import of recyclables. Obviously, they are a big exporter, not of recyclables but a big exporter of products. And so they needed corrugated cardboard. They announced that for whatever reason they were shutting down the import of OCC, which stands for old corrugated cardboard. They were our single biggest customer on the recycling stuff. And now they will shrink to simply zero by the end of this year. I couldn\u2019t tell you exactly what their motives were, whether they were environmental, whether they were economic or political or whatever. But we found really good replacements.\n\nWe\u2019ve also taken it upon ourselves to change the technology at our recycle plants. Part of what they said was that the material coming to them was contaminated. And so we\u2019ve taken it upon ourselves to really innovate, and we\u2019ve built a new plant in Chicago, for example, that probably is going to be a carbon copy for what we do with future recycle plants. There aren\u2019t as many people at the plant. It\u2019s much more technology. It\u2019s optical sorters and the like, and we think it produces a cleaner recycle stream. So it\u2019s better for the environment. It\u2019s better for us economically.\n\nI understand this Chicago facility is like the Taj Mahal of recycling. Can you just tell me a little bit more about it?\n\nThis facility has I think 14 optical sorters, which is a lot. So from a capital standpoint, it is more expensive.\n\nWhat do the sorters do?\n\nAn optical sorter has pretty amazing technology. You\u2019ve got a conveyor belt that\u2019s coming through pretty quickly. And an optical sorter is able to look at what\u2019s coming on that conveyor belt, and at the right time, it shoots a jet of air. And it can knock that piece of plastic, that Tide bottle, into a particular bin, So it\u2019s amazing technology that is able to actually identify it quickly, and then at the same time shoot this stream of air and knock that plastic off of the conveyor belt. So it saves having a person pull it off.\n\nIs the average household getting better at recycling?\n\nMost of us who recycle, we honestly are trying to put what\u2019s recyclable in the recycle bin. There are some people that use the recycle bin as trash overflow. I mean, look, don\u2019t put your turkey carcass in the recycle bin. And people that do that, they know better.\n\nI mean, look, don\u2019t put your turkey carcass in the recycle bin. And people that do that, they know better. - Waste Management CEO Jim Fish\n\nWhat regions are the best recyclers?\n\nThe Pacific Northwest has done a really good job with education. Minnesota is another place that\u2019s done a good job. There are parts of New York; upstate New York in particular has done a nice job.\n\nLet\u2019s put this urban myth to rest once and for all: Bowling balls are not recyclable, right?\n\nWe do get a lot of bowling balls, and I don\u2019t know why. How many bowling balls are out there, for goodness\u2019 sake? I couldn\u2019t tell you what a bowling ball\u2019s made of. I\u2019m not a big bowler, but it\u2019s not metal and it\u2019s not cardboard [which means it is not recyclable].\n\nAnd what do you do with them, start a bowling league?\n\nThey end up going in the trash. What happens with this stuff that ultimately is not recyclable, it comes into a recycle plant, is it goes into this kind of contamination pile. And that all ends up going to a landfill.\n\nHave you ever engaged in dumpster diving?\n\nI have, actually, a long time ago. I lost my wallet, and I thought maybe it had gotten thrown in the trash. I was living in an apartment complex, so I went out to the dumpster at that complex and I went through it. I didn\u2019t find it.\n\nFISH\u2019S FAVORITES:\n\nLEADERSHIP BOOK: I don\u2019t read a ton of those leadership books. I feel like they all kind of sound the same after a while. But I like Execution, by Larry Bossidy.\n\nAUTHOR: I just finished Team of Rivals [by Doris Kearns Goodwin].\n\nAPP: been, a travel app.\n\nEXERCISE ROUTINE: I was having lower-back problems; my wife got me into Pilates.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nThe Leadership Brief.

{"title": "The Nightmare Pandemic Economy Joe Biden Is Inheriting, in 5 Charts", "transcript": "When President-elect Joe Biden steps into White House in January, he will inherit two inextricably linked crises: The worsening COVID-19 pandemic and a wide-reaching recession. As U.S. coronavirus cases are spiking to all-time highs, he will be responsible for keeping Americans safe while guiding a fragile economy through recovery.\n\nThat\u2019s a tall order\u2014and a somewhat paradoxical one. A fully open economy will most certainly lead to more viral spread and likely result in more deaths, while a closed economy could contain the virus but bring about even more financial hardship. And as the weather cools and fewer people want to dine, drink or otherwise spend time outside, it will become even harder to find the right mix of policies to both curb spread and keep businesses (and their employees) afloat.\n\nBiden has already demonstrated a more hands-on approach to the pandemic than U.S. President Donald Trump. In his first order of business after being projected the winner, the President-elect established a COVID-19 advisory board to guide his thinking and work with state and local health officials. The group, Biden\u2019s transition team says, will develop public-health strategies based on scientific information to \u201creopen our schools and businesses safely and effectively,\u201d among other goals.\n\nStill, the task at hand will be difficult, to say the least. The following five charts show what Biden and his Vice President-elect, Kamala Harris, are up against as they prepare to take the oaths of office.\n\n1. Americans don\u2019t agree on the best course of action\n\nThe coronavirus has affected almost every country around the world. Many have taken an economic hit this year as a result. However, while citizens of other countries generally agree on how to move forward, Americans have a wide ideological divide that could make Biden\u2019s job much harder, as presidents often draw on public support to help push their agendas forward.\n\nA Pew survey conducted over the summer found that, among citizens of economically advanced countries struggling to contain the virus, Americans were the most polarized along party lines in their assessment of their government\u2019s response to the virus and the economy. Furthermore, another Pew poll from October revealed that only 24% of Trump supporters said the coronavirus outbreak was very important to their vote, compared with 82% of Biden supporters. Conversely, 84% of Trump supporters said the economy was very important, versus 66% of Biden supporters.\n\nBiden has pledged to follow the advice of public-health advisors, even if they recommend shutting down businesses. Biden\u2019s supporters may applaud that approach, but he will find it challenging to convince the rest of the country it\u2019s the right way to go\u2014especially Trump\u2019s most ardent loyalists, many of whom have shunned even basic preventative measures, like masks.\n\n2. Lawmakers don\u2019t agree, either\n\nElection Day resulted in a narrower Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, while two Jan. 5 runoff elections in Georgia will determine whether the Senate remains narrowly in Republican control or gets split down the middle, with Harris casting a tie-breaking vote when necessary.\n\nEither way, the congressional situation is a major obstacle for Biden\u2019s agenda, writes TIME\u2019s Abby Vesoulis. As she notes, the President-elect may get only parts of his broad plans\u2014spanning everything from childcare to infrastructure to climate change\u2014through a gridlocked Congress.\n\nOn the coronavirus front, Biden has called for federal relief programs\u2014including loans for small businesses, direct payments to working families and student loan forgiveness\u2014to serve as a financial bridge until the virus is under control. He has also proposed employing tens of thousands of COVID-19 contact tracers as a means of both curbing viral spread and chipping away at the high unemployment rate.\n\nFederal relief programs are not new for Biden, who, as vice president to Barack Obama during the height of the Great Recession, helped shepherd a $787 billion stimulus package through Congress in 2009. But back then, he had the benefit of a significant Democratic majority in both chambers, making it easier to put the Obama Administration\u2019s goals into practice.\n\n3. The unemployment crisis is worse than it seems\n\nThe overall U.S. unemployment rate is currently 6.9%, which, while better than April\u2019s 14.7%, still means that 10 million pre-pandemic jobs remain M.I.A., according to Nov. 6 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Economists have said that the jobs that haven\u2019t returned by this point will be the hardest to claw back, in part because they are concentrated in the industries most affected by virus containment measures, like leisure, travel and hospitality.\n\nThe Trump-era employment gains may not continue at the same pace under Biden, because prolonged unemployment, especially in a weak labor market, can be harder to fix. People who have been unemployed for six months or more are about twice as likely to drop out of the labor force as to find employment, according to a U.S. Federal Reserve analysis of unemployment trends during the Great Recession. Additionally, the longer a person is out of work, the less consumer purchasing they do, which further slows economic growth.\n\nAlarming BLS data show that long-term unemployment as a share of all unemployment is growing fast. In October, 3.6 million of the 11 million unemployed Americans\u2014or one in three\u2014had been out of work for six months or longer. That\u2019s a ratio not seen since mid-2014, when Biden was VP and the unemployment rate, like today, topped 6%.\n\nThe continuing unemployment crisis has led economists to become increasingly pessimistic about when the country might return to pre-pandemic levels. Business and academic economists surveyed by the Wall Street Journal in April predicted the labor market would recover by 2022. But when surveyed again in October, 55% had extended their recovery forecast to 2023 or later.\n\n4. Biden can\u2019t fix the coronavirus or the economy without addressing systemic racism\n\n2020 brought the country\u2019s ongoing struggle with racism to the fore, as police brutality and other forms of violence against Black people led to nationwide Black Lives Matter (BLM) demonstrations. But systemic racism hasn\u2019t been on display just in horrifying viral videos\u2014it has also been apparent as COVID-19 ravaged Black communities in particular.\n\nSystemic racism has made it harder for Black communities to achieve the wealth, access to health care and overall prosperity that white communities enjoy. As a result, Black people in the U.S. are most vulnerable to the virus itself, as well as the economic disruptions it has brought on. A disproportionate share of Black Americans have fallen severely ill from the virus. They are more likely to hold lower-wage, public-facing, front-line worker positions that put them at greater risk of exposure. And they are less likely to have accumulated savings to pay the bills if their jobs disappear. Addressing the pandemic\u2019s health and economic effects requires acknowledging these facts, and acting accordingly.\n\n5. We\u2019re not out of this yet\n\nOn Nov. 9, pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced promising results from its vaccine effectiveness trials; other companies are also in late-stage trials. The stock market surged on the news, as investors predicted that the vaccine will suppress case rates and therefore expedite economic recovery.\n\nBut that won\u2019t happen immediately, even if the vaccine is highly effective in a biological sense. Public-health strategies will continue to be critical during the time it will take to produce, distribute and widely administer a vaccine. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is planning a phased rollout starting with high-risk populations, is anticipating that a limited number of doses will be available at first. If the rollout happens as quickly as President Trump has touted, mass vaccination could take Biden\u2019s entire first term.\n\nAnother obstacle: for a vaccine to work, people need to actually receive it\u2014but survey data suggest that many Americans aren\u2019t on board. The chart below, adapted from STAT and The Harris Poll, shows that only about 58% of Americans surveyed in October plan to get a vaccine as soon as one is available\u2014down from 69% in August. The hesitancy is even more pronounced among Black Americans, with only 43% reportedly planning to get vaccinated right away.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say how effective Biden will be in balancing public-health measures with the economic consequences of viral containment. Other countries have shown such a balancing is possible\u2014Germany, South Korea and Japan, for instance, have experienced fewer deaths per capita and less severe economic losses than the U.S., as measured by gross domestic product declines since late 2019.\n\nBut it\u2019s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Other nations benefit from a stronger consensus among citizens on the best path forward. Moreover, some have social safety nets that cushion the blows from economic disruptions. And not all countries have the added complication of deep-seated racism that has disproportionately affected minority communities in the U.S.\n\nStill, Biden believes the government needs to do better, and he campaigned on the promise of finding middle ground. In the last pre-election debate, he suggested that health and economic goals are not necessarily in competition\u2014that if the nation is healthy, then the economy will be, too. His challenge now will be channeling that idea into effective policy. Given that states, rather than the national government, have the most power to issue and enforce public-health rules, expect him to start by working with\u2014or, in some cases, perhaps even pressuring\u2014the country\u2019s governors to follow his lead.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

{"title": "Why You May Not Be Able to Get Pfizer\u2019s Frontrunner COVID-19 Vaccine", "transcript": "The freezer in your kitchen likely gets down to temperatures around -20\u00b0 C (-4\u00b0 F). \u201cThat keeps your ice cream cold, but it doesn\u2019t turn your ice cream into an impenetrable block of ice,\u201d says Paula Cannon, an associate professor of molecular microbiology and immunology at the University of Southern California\u2019s Keck School of Medicine.\n\nPfizer\u2019s promising COVID-19 vaccine, by contrast, must be stored at about -70\u00b0 C (-94\u00b0 F)\u2014a temperature cold enough to harden ice cream into a spoon-breaking block of ice, and that only specialized freezers can produce.\n\nThose cold storage requirements are raising serious questions about who could get the Pfizer vaccine if it\u2019s approved, and when. The reality, experts say, is that the Pfizer vaccine probably won\u2019t be available to everyone, at least not right away. Large medical centers and urban centers are the most likely to have the resources necessary for ultra-cold storage. People without access to these facilities, such as those living in rural areas, nursing homes and developing nations, may have to wait for other vaccines working their way through the development pipeline.\n\nPfizer\u2019s vaccine candidate, which has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration but is reportedly 90% effective at preventing COVID-19, uses genetic material called mRNA. If it\u2019s not kept at extremely cold temperatures, mRNA can break down, rendering the vaccine unusable.\n\nIf the Pfizer vaccine is kept at -70\u00b0 C, it can last up to six months. But many hospitals, to say nothing of community medical offices and pharmacies, do not have ultra-cold freezers, which cost around $10,000 up front and are expensive to run because of their high energy usage. Retrofitting existing freezers to reach these temperatures isn\u2019t possible either, Cannon says. \u201cIt would be like going from a Fiat car to a Tundra truck\u201d\u2014the technology and energy requirements are simply different.\n\nThere may also be shortages of the type of pharmaceutical-grade glass needed to make vials that can withstand such cold temperatures, says Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. New York-based glass company Corning won a $204 million government grant in June specifically so it could increase production of its sturdy glass, which is made without boron.\n\nDistributing the vaccine will also be difficult, since it must remain frozen during shipping. Pfizer has built a storage container that, with the help of dry ice, can keep doses cold for up to 10 days in transit without any additional freezer equipment. Periodically replenishing the containers with dry ice can buy another 15 days, but depending on how often the containers are opened, and for how long, that timeline could be considerably shorter. (Dry ice is also in short supply right now because of the increase in food delivery during the pandemic, combined with the fact that fewer people are driving and buying gas, driving down the ethanol production required to make dry ice.)\n\nOnce they\u2019re out of the box, the shots can last for about five days in standard refrigeration. But the boxes hold from 200 to 1,000 vaccine vials, each of which contains about five doses of the shot\u2014more than most doctor\u2019s offices could reasonably expect to use before some doses start to defrost and become useless, as ProPublica recently reported.\n\nA Pfizer spokesperson told TIME that the company \u201cis committed to ensuring everyone has the opportunity to have access to our vaccine working closely with local government.\u201d The spokesperson added that global distribution has gone smoothly during clinical trials, and that portable and under-the-counter-sized ultra-cold freezers are available for smaller vaccination sites.\n\n\u201cWe believe all countries will be able to effectively dose patients even with our cold chain requirements,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nFor mass U.S. distribution, Cannon says the most practical solution may be setting up large, centralized vaccination centers that could rapidly go through doses, rather than trying to get the jab into every doctor\u2019s office and pharmacy nationwide. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Nov. 12 announced it will work with pharmacies nationwide to distributes COVID-19 vaccines for free, but it\u2019s not yet clear which vaccines will be available through that partnership.\n\nSome states are considering large vaccine depots, as indicated by their draft plans for vaccine rollout sent to the CDC, but such centralized hubs require additional staff, equipment and cost that some states can\u2019t afford. Plus, in rural areas, reaching a \u201ccentralized\u201d location may still require lengthy travel for some people. The Pfizer vaccine must also be given in two separate doses, which could be a hard sell to people who have to drive hours to get it.\n\nMoss adds that those who need the vaccine most\u2014like the elderly and those with prior health conditions\u2014may be the least able to travel to get one. And distributing an ultra-cold vaccine may be a pipe dream in countries poorer than the U.S., Moss says.\n\n\u201cIt would be extremely challenging, if not impossible, to get such a vaccine out to, say, countries and people in Sub-Saharan African and many parts of Asia, where the infrastructure is not what we have in the United States,\u201d he says.\n\nPat Lennon, who oversees cold-chain storage at the global health nonprofit PATH, says ultra-cold vaccines were distributed during the recent Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, but that was an easier feat, since the virus did not spread as widely.\n\nMoss says he\u2019s not overly concerned about distribution challenges, at least right now. Pfizer\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine is one of many currently in development, and \u201cI don\u2019t have any reason to think this Pfizer vaccine is special in such a way that its efficacy is going to be substantially higher than another vaccine,\u201d Moss says. (Time will tell, of course, exactly how the efficacy and availability of the different shots stack up.)\n\nMany of the other vaccine candidates currently going through clinical trials do not have such stringent cold-storage requirements. Pharmaceutical companies Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca have all said their COVID-19 vaccine candidates could be kept at temperatures of -20\u00b0 C or above, which should make distribution easier.\n\nCannon adds that Pfizer and other vaccine makers may refine their formulas over time. Some other vaccines, such as those for measles and yellow fever, are shipped in a freeze-dried format and reconstituted with water before they\u2019re administered. Something similar may be possible for COVID-19 vaccines in the future, Cannon says. The Pfizer spokesperson says the company hopes to release a COVID-19 vaccine that could be stored at temperatures between 2-8\u00b0 C in 2022.\n\nBut for now, people should be prepared to wait awhile before life returns to normal. Even once vaccines are available, it will take time to achieve the widespread inoculation required to stop the virus from spreading unchecked. \u201cI would say a best-case scenario may be toward the end of 2021,\u201d Moss says. \u201cBut it\u2019s going to depend on not just vaccine availability and approvals, but the willingness of people to accept the vaccine. There\u2019s a whole other challenge and layer there.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, the best tools are the ones we\u2019ve already got: social distancing, wearing masks and washing your hands.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.
