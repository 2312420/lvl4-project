{"HSBC Shares Jump on Lower Bad-Loan Provisions": [["HSBC Shares Jump on Lower Bad-Loan Provisions", "LONDON\u2014 HSBC HSBC -0.72% Holdings PLC\u2019s shares rose after the bank took fewer provisions for bad loans in the third quarter and said it might pay a \u201cconservative\u201d dividend, the latest global bank to strike a cautiously optimistic note on a potential economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe London-based lender with Asian roots set aside $785 million in provisions for bad loans in the quarter, lower than expected and less than a third of the amount set aside in each of the first and second quarters of 2020. HSBC\u2019s shares rose almost 7%.\n\nIn another positive sign for European banks, Spain\u2019s Banco Santander SA lowered its bad-loan charges in the third quarter, posting better-than-expected profit for the period. Santander\u2019s shares rose more than 4%.\n\nAna Botin, Santander\u2019s executive chairman, said customers are recovering faster than anticipated from the pandemic shock, driving its forecast for loan-loss provisions down for the entire year. U.S. banks also had a positive third quarter despite the pandemic and recession, with JPMorgan Chase & Co. reporting a rise in profit and Citigroup Inc. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. delivering better-than-expected results.\n\nHSBC also beat earnings estimates, reporting net profit of $1.36 billion in the three months ended Sept. 30, down 54% from $2.97 billion in the same period last year. Chief Executive Noel Quinn said the results were promising because of the lower credit losses and strong capital and liquidity levels.\n\nIn addition to navigating the coronavirus crisis, HSBC is embroiled in a political clash between Beijing and Washington over the status of Hong Kong. When HSBC\u2019s top Asia executive endorsed China\u2019s extension of a national-security law to the port city in June, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described the act as a \u201cshow of fealty.\u201d\n\n\u201cGeopolitical risk, particularly relating to trade and other tensions between the U.S. and China, remains heightened,\u201d HSBC said Tuesday. \u201cInvestor and business sentiment in some sectors in Hong Kong remains dampened and ongoing tensions could result in an increasingly fragmented trade and regulatory environment.\u201d\n\nHSBC also angered Chinese authorities by sharing information about telecommunications-equipment company Huawei Technologies Co. with U.S. prosecutors in 2016. Investors are concerned the bank could be put on an \u201cunreliable entities\u201d list in China that would threaten its plans to expand its retail and commercial banking in the world\u2019s most populous nation.\n\nSuch a move by Chinese authorities would complicate HSBC\u2019s strategy of refocusing on its Asian heartland, where it makes most of its profit. Mr. Quinn said in February that he plans to shed 15% of the bank\u2019s 235,000-strong workforce by cutting business lines and customer relationships in the U.S. and Europe. HSBC was founded in Hong Kong in 1865 and moved its headquarters to London in the 1990s. HSBC said it employed 230,317 people as of Sept. 30.\n\nHSBC\u2019s decadeslong strategy of expanding across Europe, Asia and the Americas is \u201cdefunct,\u201d Manus Costello, a banking analyst at Autonomous in London, wrote in a note in September. \u201cThe intention to generate profits from outside Asia has largely failed.\u201d\n\nMr. Quinn quashed speculation that the renewed focus on Asia may lead to HSBC\u2019s headquarters moving back to Hong Kong.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not intending to review the domicile of the bank,\u201d Mr. Quinn told journalists. \u201cWe took that decision a few years ago and we do not see any reason to revisit that decision.\u201d\n\nHSBC is starting a new digital wealth planning and insurance unit in China called Pinnacle, which will hire between 2,000 and 3,000 employees in the next four years. Pinnacle has obtained a fintech license in China, a first for a foreign financial institution in the country, Mr. Quinn said.\n\nShares of HSBC have fallen 42% this year and recently touched a 25-year low. Many other bank stocks have tumbled as the coronavirus wreaked economic damage and forced central banks to slash interest rates, which makes it harder for lenders to earn profit. The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index has fallen 39% this year.\n\nThe bank said it may pay a \u201cconservative dividend\u201d for 2020 if regulators permit it. The Bank of England this year told U.K. banks not to pay dividends to conserve cash during the pandemic.\n\nHSBC set aside $3.83 billion and $3 billion in provisions for losses from loans in the first and second quarters, respectively, making a total of $7.64 billion so far this year.\n\nEwen Stevenson, HSBC\u2019s chief financial officer, said the bank could add between $500 million and $1 billion in provisions in the fourth quarter if the U.K. and European Union fail to reach a trade agreement in the next few weeks.\n\nWrite to Simon Clark at simon.clark@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}
{"U.S. Election Adds to Turkish Lira's Bumpy Ride": [["U.S. Election Adds to Turkish Lira's Bumpy Ride", "Investors already wary of Turkish assets have a new reason for caution: the U.S. election.\n\nThe Turkish lira, which has lost a quarter of its value against the greenback this year, tumbled past 8 lira to the dollar for the first time Monday as investors considered how the presidential vote could compound longstanding concerns over Turkey\u2019s economic outlook. On Tuesday, the currency hit a record low at 8.15 lira to the dollar.\n\nLast week, Turkey, a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, confirmed it conducted a missile-firing exercise with an advanced air-defense system it has procured from Russia. The U.S. Department of Defense criticized the move, stoking concerns that it could lead to sanctions against Turkey that analysts and investors see as more likely if Joe Biden is elected. The Biden campaign didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis has exacerbated pressure on the lira from last week when Turkey\u2019s central banksurprised investors by not hiking rates. Earlier this year, it repeatedly cut interest rates in a quest for growth. That moved interest rates below inflation, discouraging investors from holding Turkish assets.\n\nThe desire for growth, championed by President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, also saw an expansion of credit to households and businesses. This increased the gap between imports and exports, widening the current-account deficit.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkish exports have fallen during the pandemic, and the central bank has spent billions of dollars defending the lira, drawing down its reserves.\n\nTurkey no longer has enough reserves to cover two months of imported goods, according to data from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cTurkey is in a very difficult position anyway because it\u2019s facing an unprecedented crisis and the authorities have not provided the needed response,\u201d said Nikolay Markov, a senior economist at Pictet Asset Management. \u201cIf we add the presidential election to that, the risk is quite elevated.\u201d\n\nIf he wins, Joe Biden is expected to take a tougher stance against Turkey than President Trump. Photo: jim watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMr. Biden has yet to outline any specific Turkey policies. Still, analysts said they expected him to take a tougher stance against Mr. Erdogan than Mr. Trump based on declarations he has made when he was vice president, as well as during the 2020 campaign.\n\nIn January, Mr. Biden said in a New York Times interview that he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d by Turkey\u2019s acquisition of Russian air-defense systems, known as S-400, adding that Mr. Erdogan had to \u201cpay a price\u201d for it. Mr. Biden called the Turkish president an autocrat, and said he was in favor of supporting political opponents to defeat him in elections.\n\nWhen excerpts of the interview resurfaced in Turkish media this summer, Mr. Erdogan\u2019s spokesman, Ibrahim Kal\u0131n, said Mr. Biden\u2019s comments were \u201cbased on pure ignorance, arrogance and hypocrisy.\u201d\n\nTurkey\u2019s acquisition of S-400 will trigger legally mandated congressional sanctions, but their scope is still unclear.\n\nAlthough the Trump administration has had repeated run-ins with Turkey\u2014including regarding the prolonged detention of a U.S. pastor in a Turkish jail, as well over Syria\u2014Messrs. Trump and Erdogan have displayed a warm relationship.\n\nMr. Erdogan\u2019s administration has clashed with the European Union\u2014its largest trading partner\u2014in recent months over issues including maritime rights in the east Mediterranean and the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. On Sunday, France said it would recall its ambassador to Turkey after Mr. Erodgan suggested that French President Emmanuel Macron needed a mental health check and called on Turks to boycott French goods.\n\nInvestors expect that, if elected, Mr. Biden would work more with international institutions and be more collaborative with European allies, Mr. Markov said, contributing to concerns that conflicts between the EU and Turkey could lead to more aggressive sanctions against Turkey.\n\nOther investors said a Biden administration would have to reckon with the fact that Turkey plays a strategic role as guardian of NATO\u2019s southeastern flank, and move cautiously with sanctions.\n\n\u201cTurkey is a strategic partner, and will remain a strategic partner to the West.\u201d said Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging markets debt at BlueBay Asset Management. She added that central bank policy, rather than geopolitics, would guide her decision regarding exposure to Turkey.\n\nWrite to Caitlin Ostroff at caitlin.ostroff@wsj.com and David Gauthier-Villars at David.Gauthier-Villars@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}

In the first half of this year its operating margin was 34%, meaning that for every dollar it took in as revenue, it made 34 cents of profit, before interest and tax payments.\n\nThat revenue comes from two main sources. Ant collects fees from merchants when people transact with Alipay, and earns fees from banks and other financial companies that make loans or sell investment products on its platforms.

{"These Real-Estate Loans Require a New York State of Mind": [["These Real-Estate Loans Require a New York State of Mind", "Across the U.S. banking sector, bad loans remained relatively rare in the third quarter. But some of the most perplexing debts are in quarantine.\n\nTake the closely watched bellwether that is New York City commercial real estate. Thanks to Covid-19 lockdowns, working from home, high unemployment and tepid consumer spending, many Big Apple properties ranging from offices to storefronts to apartments are under some form of stress.\n\nTo a large extent, banks that lend to such properties are helped by virtue of their choosiness. More speculative properties tend to be funded via debt markets; banks insist on high collateralization and can selectively work with owners whom they trust. Still, banks with portfolios in the city have been granting deferrals to borrowers that need them.\n\nWhile there was a drop-off in reported deferral rates in the third quarter from earlier this year, many loans remain on hold. For example, as of mid-October about $2 billion out of $27 billion of CRE loans at New York\u2019s Signature Bank were deferring principal and interest payments, the bank reported.\n\nUnder a section of the Cares Act, bankers say they can for now put off some decisions like whether to mark a loan as nonperforming if the borrower was waylaid by the pandemic: for example, a presently closed Broadway theater property that could reopen its doors next year. The question for investors is what is going on under the hood. Are deferred commercial property loans simply nonperforming assets-in-waiting, or are they just on pause until the pandemic subsides?\n\nIn New York, some building owners apparently are willing to pay the difference between properties\u2019 cash flow and loan payments until some normalcy returns. They are often described as wealthy families that have owned the properties for decades and have a huge interest in keeping them. Signature described this as betting on jockeys rather than horses. Buffalo-based M&T Bank, a large New York City property lender, noted that such owners have had the properties for so long that they have a very low cost and tax basis, making it worthwhile to stretch to keep paying. Moreover, superlow interest rates make debt payments more palatable, and owners might also have liquidity in other parts of their business.\n\nSome owners are also sponsors like private-equity firms. Regional lender Bank OZK, which has several hotel and office property loans in New York, said an economic rebound in the city might take longer than elsewhere. But it told analysts that it also expected sponsors backing properties would \u201ccontinue to stand behind those properties until more normal market conditions return.\u201d\n\nAnother consequence of deferrals is that they may have also temporarily short-circuited potential sales of properties whose owners might be having long-term trouble. Well-funded distressed real-estate buyers might emerge for troubled properties once they are no longer eligible for deferral. That dynamic already is emerging in other parts of the market. PNC Financial Services Group Chief Executive William Demchak, speaking about the bank\u2019s business servicing commercial mortgage-backed securities, said that \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of capital on the sidelines\u201d and described \u201ca pretty active secondary market for real-estate properties at the moment.\u201d\n\nThe lesson might be that, when it comes to bank lending, tracking metrics such as rent collection, vacancy rates or projected asset values are to some extent not the immediate issue. Yes, those measure underlying stress. But bankers often rely more on the health of property owners and the larger real-estate market\u2014and with the Federal Reserve helping keep capital markets buoyant, it gives owners many options to keep things afloat.\n\nParts of the Covid-19 economy might look ugly from the streets. Behind closed doors though, there is still a lot of cash sloshing around.\n\nWrite to Telis Demos at telis.demos@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}
{"Why the U.S. Can't Replicate South Korea's Impressive Economic Recovery": [["Why the U.S. Can't Replicate South Korea's Impressive Economic Recovery", "South Korea\u2019s recession ended in the third quarter of the year with the economy growing 1.9% from the second quarter. The country\u2019s commendable control of Covid-19 has helped\u2014but like China, its pre-existing economic structure was also key.\n\nThe real secret sauce for coming back from Covid-19 has been a mix of the two: getting the virus under control early, and benefiting from an existing export-heavy economic model.\n\nAt 5.5 percentage points, exports made the largest contribution to Korea\u2019s GDP growth since at least 1960. Without that export boom, a slump in capital investment would have left Korea in recession. Private expenditures dropped 0.1% quarter-on-quarter.\n\nA lift in exports has an outsize effect on Korea because the economy is far more trade oriented than most. In 2019, exports ran to about 40% of the country\u2019s GDP, compared with 18.4% in China and 11.7% in the U.S.\n\nBreaking down the components of the surge offers the clearest indication of why most economies in North America and Western Europe would struggle to replicate Korea\u2019s performance. In September, the country\u2019s three largest export groups\u2014covering items such as electrical machinery, machine tools and heating equipment, and vehicles and their parts\u2014all grew by more than 10% year-over-year. That is actually markedly stronger than the growth rates for the same period a year earlier.\n\nGermany, Europe\u2019s export champion, hasn\u2019t controlled the virus as successfully as Korea or China, but has done well by European standards. Its third-quarter GDP won\u2019t be released until the end of the month, but the International Monetary Fund expects the economy to contract by 6% this year, somewhat less than the 9.8% contraction forecast for both France and the U.K., or the double-digit drops projected for Italy and Spain.\n\nSimply put, Korea\u2019s expansion is in part to do with manufacturing the things that have found continued demand in the face of a global economic freeze this year. Its goods exports are now just 0.6% shy of their level one year ago, while services exports are still down 23.4%. Even if they had exercised Seoul\u2019s impressive control over the spread of the virus, services-focused exporters would struggle to mimic that outcome.\n\nThe Korean economy now needs to grow about 2.8% to return to its size at the beginning of 2020. That is roughly the pace of growth that the International Monetary Fund expects for 2021.\n\nThe story for the Chinese, Taiwanese and Vietnamese economies is similar. All are undoubtedly doing better than would otherwise be the case if they had large, ongoing Covid-19 outbreaks, but a very large proportion of their outperformance should also be attributed to their economic structure going into the pandemic.\n\nFor some countries to be major net exporters, others must be net importers. Not every economy can grow by leaning on demand from overseas. Though controlling the virus is a prerequisite for an economic recovery, structure matters just as much\u2014if not more.\n\nRelated Video Economists have long used letters of the alphabet like V and U to describe economic recoveries. But the coronavirus downturn is so different from past recessions that economists are coming up with new shapes to describe the potential recovery. WSJ explains.

{"Global Banks in Hong Kong Breathe Easier Over U.S. Sanctions": [["Global Banks in Hong Kong Breathe Easier Over U.S. Sanctions", "U.S. sanctions over Hong Kong are likely to pose fewer headaches for international banks operating in the financial hub than first feared, lawyers say.\n\nBanks have been on notice since July, when President Trump signed a law targeting people the U.S. sees as undermining Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, and those handling their finances. In a worst-case scenario, firms could effectively be cut off from the American financial system. The U.S. action followed Beijing\u2019s imposition of a tough new national-security law in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Treasury Department has until mid-December to produce a blacklist of foreign financial institutions, after its counterparts at the State Department named Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam and nine other officials as individual targets earlier this month.\n\nLegal experts say operating in Hong Kong has become more unpredictable and complex for banks. Still, they have drawn reassurance from the fact the U.S. hasn\u2019t expanded on an earlier presidential blacklist of sanctioned officials, and from its advice to financial institutions.\n\nThe Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control recently said it would ask banks about suspicious transactions before placing them on any blacklist, and it would give them time to end problematic banking relationships, noted Nicholas Turner, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson LLP.\n\n\u201cBanks are breathing a sigh of relief,\u201d said Mr. Turner, who advises financial institutions on compliance and economic-sanctions issues. \u201cThe Treasury guidance suggests that a bank won\u2019t get caught off guard by a sanctions announcement without receiving some form of communication from Treasury prior to that.\u201d\n\nHong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam, left, shaking hands with Chen Daoxiang, commander of the People\u2019s Liberation Army Garrison in Hong Kong. Ms. Lam was among those targeted by U.S. sanctions. Photo: Wu Xiaochu/Zuma Press\n\nHong Kong is home to many international banks, investment firms and insurers. They have favored it over other Chinese cities partly because Hong Kong has a distinct legal system, and is free of the capital controls that apply in mainland China.\n\nBenjamin Kostrzewa, a lawyer at Hogan Lovells in Hong Kong, said it was also helpful that the State Department list consisted of just 10 people, all of whom had already been named by President Trump in a separate executive order in August. That earlier move imposed U.S. asset freezes and travel bans on Ms. Lam and various other officials.\n\n\u201cThe State Department report was good news for Hong Kong, as they didn\u2019t add in new officials or entities,\u201d said Mr. Kostrzewa, who was formerly a lawyer at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nIn practice, banks may have only needed to take a few concrete steps. For example, Citigroup Inc., which has a retail branch network in the city, has suspended one credit card as a result of the sanctions, said a person familiar with the matter.\n\nBankers and lawyers say Hong Kong\u2019s financial industry isn\u2019t necessarily out of the woods, as the Hong Kong Autonomy Act that became law in July gives Washington discretion to expand the sanctions\u2019 scope at any time.\n\n\u201c \u201cBanks are breathing a sigh of relief.\u201d \u201d \u2014 Nicholas Turner, Steptoe & Johnson LLP\n\n\u201cA lot of it depends on the status of the U.S.-China relationship and whether the U.S. government decides to try to exert more pressure on China and Hong Kong,\u201d said Chen Zhu, a Hong Kong-based partner at Morrison & Foerster LLP.\n\nThe U.S. has broadened other sanctions recently, adding corporate entities to a list of targets it says should be punished for human-rights abuses in China\u2019s northwestern Xinjiang region.\n\nAll told, operating in Hong Kong has become more complex for international banks, and in some cases more politically fraught, too. HSBC Holdings PLC in particular has come in for U.S. criticism, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attacking it for shutting accounts \u201cfor those seeking freedom.\u201d\n\nDora Wang, a partner at law firm Reed Smith LLP, said while global financial institutions had always operated in places that threw up sanctions issues, this hadn\u2019t been a major concern in Hong Kong until recently.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Wang said updates on sanction targets and regulations concerning Hong Kong will become more frequent with the city now a focus in U.S.-China relations. That meant banks \u201cwould need to step up their risk-assessment efforts and shore up their compliance controls,\u201d even if they weren\u2019t targets themselves, she said.\n\nChinese banks could also find it harder to escape censure. Matthew Tuchband, Washington-based counsel at Arent Fox and former deputy chief counsel at the OFAC, said whether or not Mr. Trump wins the Nov. 3 election, \u201cthe conditions would be ripe for President Trump to take an additional swipe at China by listing Chinese banks.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand, Chen Shujin, a banking analyst at securities firm Jefferies, said larger Chinese banks were unlikely to be sanctioned, since they would be aware of the potentially high costs involved and would act accordingly. One option would be for all problematic transactions to be shifted to a single, smaller Chinese bank to shield other, bigger players, she said.\n\nHong Kong\u2019s new national-security law is changing how one tech CEO sees the future of his company in Asia\u2019s global hub.

{"Stock Investors' Bets Eye a Biden Victory, Robust Stimulus": [["Stock Investors' Bets Eye a Biden Victory, Robust Stimulus", "Despite the steep stock-market selloff Monday, investors appear to be positioning for a speedy outcome to the presidential contest and dwindling volatility through the end of the year.\n\nU.S. stocks, particularly those in sectors most sensitive to higher economic growth, have ascended in October, while Treasury yields have jumped as bond prices have fallen. Bets on volatility falling through the end of the year in the derivatives market picked up, after months of investors positioning for rocky markets into January.\n\nValue stocks\u2014shares of companies that typically trade at a low multiple of their book value, or net worth\u2014have outperformed. The S&P 500 Value index has advanced 1.6% in October, beating the S&P 500 Growth index\u2019s 0.8% gain. The value index is on track to beat its counterpart for the second consecutive month, something that hasn\u2019t happened all year.\n\nThose market moves suggest investors are taking their cues from polls showing former Vice President Joe Biden with a steady lead over President Trump, which increases the chances of a decisive victory. They also see a robust fiscal stimulus plan in the cards. Although other dynamics are at play in markets, ranging from the Covid-19 caseload to the vigor of the global economic recovery, many investors say increased expectations for an orderly U.S. election season have been among the key developments in recent weeks.\n\n\u201cThey no longer think the election is going to be something that takes us a long time to figure out,\u201d said Amy Wu Silverman, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets. \u201cPeople are expecting good news out of the fiscal stimulus as well as the vaccine.\u201d\n\nPeople wait to vote early outside the Barclays Center in New York City\u2019s borough of Brooklyn on Oct 24. Photo: Stephanie Keith/Getty Images\n\nMany investors had been betting on prolonged uncertainty after the election in anticipation of a surge in mail-in voting that would leave the outcome undecided for weeks.\n\nOn Monday, as U.S. stocks fell sharply and the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, climbed, some investors positioned for its fall through bearish options on the gauge, Trade Alert data show. A bearish bet on the VIX is akin to a bullish bet on the S&P 500 because the two tend to move in opposite directions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a very popular trade to position for volatility to go lower after the election,\u201d said Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group, adding that these bets appeared resilient even during the stock-market selloff on Monday.\n\nThe recent jump in the stock market\u2019s laggards, including financial shares, comes as analysts have said that a Democratic sweep of the White House and Congress could benefit the economy and markets. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analysts said earlier this month that a Democratic sweep could be a positive for stocks. UBS Group AG echoed that sentiment Friday, saying a \u201cblue wave or status quo outcome would likely be modestly better for stocks because it would lead to larger fiscal support.\u201d\n\nSHARE YOUR THOUGHTS Is the stock market is a good predictor of election results? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.\n\nBusiness leaders have also embraced the prospect of a Biden presidency, despite his push to increase taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals. Their stances highlight the importance of fiscal stimulus and how the coronavirus pandemic\u2019s impact on the economy supersedes many other factors. Democratic lawmakers in Congress have been pushing a $2.2 trillion stimulus package to combat the virus, much larger than Republicans\u2019 proposal.\n\nRepublicans are often thought to be friendlier to the stock market because of their policies on lower taxes, though stocks have tended to go up regardless of which party controls Washington. Mr. Trump\u2019s tax cuts, for example, helped boost the stock market early in his presidency. But that calculus has shifted ahead of the coming election, in part because many believe that more fiscal stimulus is needed to help the economic recovery.\n\nThe stock market doesn't decide who wins the election, but history shows that a weak performance in the run-up to the vote favors the challenger\u2014and vice versa. WSJ's Paul Vigna explains how market swings can affect President Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nIn some cases, investors say the idea of a speedy resolution to the election is more comforting than a lead in the polls by a particular candidate. Still, there remain countless unknowns about how the election will affect policy on everything from taxes to climate change and financial regulation.\n\nThe recent trading activity also highlights investors\u2019 confidence in such polling, despite several political surprises in 2016, such as Mr. Trump\u2019s victory and Brexit.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been kind of a revisiting of the sense that the objective read of the polling is the right way,\u201d said Josh Younger, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase & Co. \u201cThe wider the gap, the more decisive the victory.\u201d\n\nMr. Younger said it has recently gotten cheaper to pick up options around the presidential election.\n\nOther traders caution anxiety surrounding the election hasn\u2019t dissipated entirely, and the VIX has remained elevated even as stocks have climbed this month. On Monday, it jumped to the highest level since early September.\n\nEven some investors who had piled into exchange-traded funds that would benefit from a victory for Mr. Biden appear to be hedging their bets. Solar stocks and other alternative energy shares had surged in recent weeks, partly thanks to the expectation that they would benefit from Mr. Biden\u2019s $2 trillion package to combat climate change.\n\nBut bearish put options outstanding tied to the Invesco Solar ETF recently surged to the highest level of the year, Trade Alert data show, while the fund fell the most in a single day since March. Such contracts allow investors to sell the shares at a given price, later in time and are often used as hedges.\n\nThe chance that \u201cthere is a more chaotic outcome\u2014that probability hasn\u2019t gone away,\u201d said Parag Thatte, a strategist at Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe fear of that outcome has gone down.\u201d\n\nMore on Election 2020\n\nWrite to Gunjan Banerji at Gunjan.Banerji@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}

But would have received $600, 000 in fees from the supplier.\n\nInterest in vendor puts has bloomed recently. In good times, trade-credit insurance, which protects against defaults, is available. But insurers during the pandemic slashed coverage and companies including Neiman Marcus Group Inc. and J.Crew Group Inc. tipped into bankruptcy.\n\nThe puts work like this: A supplier grows concerned its client might not stump up for goods and services after it buys them. To protect its accounts receivable, the supplier enters into a contract of up to a year with an investor, which collects a fee upfront and agrees to purchase the receivables claims if the company collapses.\n\nSince May, suppliers have entered into put options on companies including J.C. Penney Co. , Macy\u2019s Inc. and Bed Bath & Beyond Inc., according to Cherokee Acquisition, which runs an online platform for the instruments. Transportation and technology companies are also popular, industry participants say.\n\nJPMorgan often sits in the middle, striking vendor-put deals with suppliers before passing its position onto investors. The bank says requests for prices on vendor puts are up between 30% and 50% over the past year.\n\nCredit Suisse Group AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have been involved in the vendor put market in the past, but currently JPMorgan is the only big bank with a significant presence, according to people familiar with the business.\n\nFor funds, puts can be more lucrative than credit-default swaps, another protective financial instrument. Many investors look for annualized returns of 15-18%, according to a person familiar with the trades.\n\nOn Oct. 21, it cost vendors $10,000 a month to protect a notional $1 million in receivables with a Macy\u2019s put on Cherokee\u2019s exchange. If the contract lasted a year, the equivalent credit-default swap would cost just under two-thirds as much. The flip side to this premium: Puts are hard to trade and can be costly to manage if there is a bankruptcy, said Cherokee director Bradley Max.\n\nDistressed-investment firm Avenue Capital Group notched a profitable trade in 2018 and early 2019 when Tesla Inc.\u2019s bonds were under pressure. Avenue sold puts to a company supplying body panels to the electric-vehicle maker, a person familiar with the matter said. Avenue co-founder Marc Lasry lauded the trade at the time, saying there was no reason to fear for Tesla\u2019s prospects.\n\nPuts are generally much more expensive than credit insurance, but they can\u2019t be canceled for the duration of the contract, said Shereen Furio, principal at insurance brokerage Furio Agency. She says requests are up 50% since before the crisis.\n\nSince May, suppliers have entered into put options on companies including J.C. Penney and Macy\u2019s, says Cherokee Acquisition. Photo: Richard B. Levine/Zuma Press\n\nThe wager typically pays off because most companies covered by the deals don\u2019t collapse. Losses are steep when puts are triggered, so many investors hedge by buying credit-default swaps, said Thomas Janover, a lawyer at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP, who draws up put agreements.\n\nVendor puts were created in the 1990s and dwell in a niche corner of the credit market. Popular through the 2008-2009 financial crisis, they wane during periods of economic growth when suppliers are broadly confident their customers will pay. The deals are private, but participants estimate that puts protect receivables tied to payments for hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nKaraoke-machine distributor The Singing Machine Company Inc. was readying to ship $1.3 million worth of products to Penney in September 2019. Worried about the retailer\u2019s health, Singing Machine tried and failed to find credit insurance, said Chief Financial Officer Lionel Marquis. The company decided to spring for a put after weighing the losses it would incur from selling the machines to a discount retailer instead of Penney.\n\nThe put cost $135,000 to cover goods valued at $800,000, Mr. Marquis said. Penney didn\u2019t go bankrupt at the time, but Mr. Marquis said the deal was worth it because if it had gone \u201cbelly-up then we could recover the cost of the inventory.\u201d\n\nRen\u00e9 Canezin, managing partner of Evolution Credit Partners, which is backed by Harvard University\u2019s endowment, said selling puts is attractive because the firm gets to contribute to the real economy, as the supplier is \u201cworried about his business profile; he needs to ship next month.\u201d\n\nMr. Canezin said the size of returns is linked to puts\u2019 bespoke nature, requiring time spent on research and customer service.\n\nSometimes investors and suppliers dispute their contracts. E-Lo Sportswear LLC and Lanco Apparel LLC alleged in September in a civil case in New York that ETG Capital LLC didn\u2019t pay over $1.5 million the two clothing companies claimed was owed to them under put agreements this year.\n\nAn attorney for ETG Capital said E-Lo and Lanco didn\u2019t fulfill their obligations and ETG had no contractual obligation to them. An attorney for E-Lo and Lanco said he believes their claims in the lawsuit would be found to be valid.\n\n\u2014Pat Minczeski contributed to this article.\n\nWrite to Joe Wallace at Joe.Wallace@wsj.com and Julie Steinberg at julie.steinberg@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}
{"Global Insurer AIG to Divest Life-Insurance Business": [["Global Insurer AIG to Divest Life-Insurance Business", "Insurance conglomerate American International Group Inc. AIG -3.46% is taking steps to split off its life-insurance business into a separate company, leaving it to focus on property-casualty insurance, a separation it will make under the direction of a new chief executive.\n\nIn news releases late Monday afternoon, the New York company said current Chief Executive Brian Duperreault will hand over his title on March 1 to Peter Zaffino, the company\u2019s president.\n\nThe hiving off of the life-and-retirement operations would be the latest dramatic change at a company that in the early 2000s was a financial-services behemoth with globe-straddling operations, including airplane leasing, a financial-derivatives business, and prosperous life-insurance units in far-flung locations.\n\nAIG collapsed into the U.S. government\u2019s arms in 2008 during the financial crisis, and roughly halved itself over the next four years as it raised money to fully repay taxpayers for a bailout that reached nearly $185 billion at its peak.\n\nOver the past three years, Mr. Zaffino, 53 years old, has been a key lieutenant to Mr. Duperreault, 73, and he has been widely viewed as heir apparent inside and outside the company. The two have worked on a turnaround of the property-casualty unit. That unit is a leading seller of insurance to businesses world-wide but had delivered poor results for years.\n\nMr. Duperreault said in one of the releases that AIG is now positioned to pursue a separation in which both parts of AIG could \u201cprosper as stand-alone entities.\u201d Mr. Zaffino said a separation \u201cwill enable each entity to achieve a more appropriate and sustainable valuation.\u201d\n\nThe breakup is a reversal of AIG\u2019s position back in 2015 and 2016, when shareholder activists Carl Icahn and John Paulson lobbied for a split as a way to boost shareholder returns.\n\nAt the time, AIG maintained there were benefits to being a diversified conglomerate. Its property-casualty unit was struggling with underwriting losses and a talent drain stemming partly from its years as a government ward. There were concerns about how well the business would do as an independent company. The life-insurance unit provided stability to AIG\u2019s results.\n\nNow, Messrs. Duperreault and Zaffino, who both joined AIG in the wake of the shareholder activism, are credited by Wall Street analysts with successfully fixing most of the property-casualty unit\u2019s problems and giving it strong growth possibilities.\n\nThis time, it is AIG\u2019s life-insurance business facing a tougher outlook due to a plunge in U.S. Treasury yields earlier this year, following a decade of already low rates, as Covid-19 spread world-wide.\n\nLow interest rates hurt life insurers in part because they depend on interest income on big bond portfolios for a substantial portion of their profits. Many industry executives expect rates to stay at ultralow levels and continue posing challenges to life insurers for years.\n\nIn recent months, AIG\u2019s shares have underperformed many of its property-casualty-specific peers, even as its property-casualty results improved, as many investors don\u2019t want exposure to life insurers because of their tough outlook.\n\nAIG shares are down 39.1 % in the year to date, compared with 9.5% for the S&P Property & Casualty Insurance Index. The steep drop is more in line with the S&P Life & Health Insurance Index, which is down 27.7%. AIG\u2019s market capitalization has shrunk to about $26.9 billion.\n\nAIG said that \u201cno decisions have been made as to how to achieve a full separation.\u201d The board aims \u201cto accomplish it in a way that maximizes shareholder value and establishes two independent, market-leading companies.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, the life-and-retirement business represented about one-third of AIG\u2019s adjusted revenue and 63% of its adjusted pretax income, as the property-casualty unit was battling to deliver better results. The life-and-retirement business represented about half of AIG\u2019s total assets of $569 billion at June 30.\n\nThe releases don\u2019t elaborate on potential paths for the separation. One option could be an initial public stock offering. French insurance conglomerate AXA SA, a rival to AIG, went this route in 2018 with an IPO of its large U.S.life-insurance business, which now trades as Equitable Holdings Inc.\n\nOr AIG might sell a sliver of the unit to another company or entity, ultimately disposing of the entire business.\n\nAIG is expected to proceed slowly in the separation as a way to use up remaining valuable deferred-tax assets that were generated as a result of the huge losses it suffered during the financial crisis. Those tax assets tallied $17.1 billion at year-end 2015 and were down to $8.99 billion at year-end 2019. AIG\u2019s crisis-era woes stemmed from sales of risky financial derivatives.\n\nMr. Duperreault will become executive chairman of AIG\u2019s board. The current independent chairman, former airline executive Douglas M. Steenland, will switch to become lead independent director. Mr. Zaffino is immediately becoming an AIG director.\n\nMr. Zaffino was a senior executive at Marsh & McLennan Cos. before joining AIG, and had worked with Mr. Duperreault when Mr. Duperreault was CEO there between 2008 and 2012. Mr. Duperreault joined AIG in May 2017 as CEO, and Mr. Zaffino was one of his first hires.\n\nMr. Duperreault had been mum about a possible retirement date, even as analysts have speculated that his tenure would only last a few years.\n\nIn another release Monday, AIG said that its catastrophe losses for the third quarter totaled $790 million, before taxes, of which $185 million would go to claims related to Covid-19, \u201cprincipally in its travel, event cancellation, trade credit, property, agriculture and casualty books of business.\u201d The remainder reflects wind and tropical storms in the Americas and Japan, and wildfires on the West coast.\n\nMr. Duperreault said the various events, including Covid-19, \u201chad a limited impact on AIG\u201d due to \u201cunderwriting discipline, reinsurance programs, revamped risk appetite and the strength of our balance sheet.\u201d\n\nWrite to Leslie Scism at leslie.scism@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}

Volatility in currency pairs has declined after a September spike when investors scooped up options strategies to protect them against big swings in the dollar and stock markets.\n\nMany on Wall Street expect Democrats to end up with control of the White House and both houses of Congress, reducing the odds of a disputed or divided outcome while increasing the odds of further fiscal stimulus and greater government spending.\n\n\u201cForeign-exchange markets are more confident in a Biden victory and to some extent a Blue Wave as well,\u201d said Mazen Issa, a currency strategist at TD Securities. \u201cElection uncertainty, while prevalent, has subsided.\u201d\n\nDerivatives tied to the Japanese yen\u2014often a haven for nervous investors\u2014have dropped in price, as measured by the cost for straddles.

PREVIEW\n\nAmong the biggest decliners were the travel and leisure stocks that have come under the most pressure this year during the pandemic. Royal Caribbean Group RCL -9.65% dropped 9.6%, United Airlines Holdings UAL -7.02% fell 7% and Marriott International MAR -5.64% declined 5.6%.\n\n\u201cThe ability to fight the virus further right now is very much in question, and it\u2019s a political question,\u201d said Steven Wieting, chief strategist at Citi Private Bank. It could be months before anything gets done in Washington, and that has made investors tentative, he said.\n\nThe Dow fell 650.19 points, or 2.3%, to 27685.38, paring an early-afternoon loss of as much as 965 points. Apple was the only stock in the index to finish the day in the green, rising a penny.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 64.42 points, or 1.9%, to 3400.97. The Nasdaq Composite dropped 189.34 points, or 1.6%, to 11358.94. All three indexes are down more than 5% from their records earlier this year.\n\nThe average number of new coronavirus cases reported daily over the past week reached an all-time high of 68,767 on Monday. Scientists had been expecting cooler weather to lead to a second wave of the disease, but the swell is coming earlier than many had anticipated. That is prompting fresh concerns about tighter lockdown restrictions and the effect on the economy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a worrying picture for sure,\u201d said David Stubbs, head of investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \u201cBut we always knew this recovery would be stop-start: We won\u2019t be truly moving into the main part of a new cycle until the health-care issue itself is dealt with.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the chances of a stimulus package coming together before the election next Tuesday are looking increasingly slim, and the possibility, if President Trump is defeated, of no additional relief coming before late January is rising. Democrats and White House officials have blamed each other for the lack of progress.\n\nA selloff here isn\u2019t surprising, said Esty Dwek, head of global market strategy at Natixis Investment Managers. Last week the market was optimistic about stimulus aid, and this week those hopes have been leveled somewhat.\n\nMoreover, some polls suggest key Senate races are tightening, Ms. Dwek said, cutting into expectations of a turnover that would allow Democrats to pass an aggressive stimulus package after the inauguration. \u201cThe blue wave might not be as much of a given,\u201d she said.\n\nHistorically, the week before a presidential election is good for stocks. Since 1928, the market has usually risen in the last full week before the contest. The S&P 500 has been up in 70% of those weeks, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The gains are even more frequent if measured from the Tuesday before the election to Election Day. The index has risen in 91% of those instances.\n\nInvestors are also still tuned in to third-quarter earnings season. A heavy calendar this week includes Microsoft, Caterpillar, Apple, Amazon.com, 3M, ConocoPhillips and Alphabet.\n\nThe critical element isn\u2019t necessarily the results themselves, said Fawad Razaqzada, an analyst at ThinkMarkets, but the corporate outlooks for the next few quarters. If executives start pointing to weaker earnings growth and a slowing economy, it could cut into the market\u2019s momentum, he said. \u201cPeople are generally optimistic about the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThis might be a reality check.\u201d\n\nCorporate earnings are expected to turn a corner in the current reporting season. Although profits are still expected to fall sharply from a year earlier, analysts project a rebound from the second quarter and a return to growth in 2021.\n\nThe beaten-down energy sector was the weakest performer in the S&P 500 Monday, falling 3.5%. The industrials, materials, communications services, financials and information technology groups also fell more than 2%. Utilities were a relative bright spot, dropping less than 0.1%.\n\nElsewhere, the pan-continental Stoxx Europe 600 retreated 1.8%, led by a decline in German stocks. Coronavirus cases are accelerating in Europe. France reported more than 52,000 new infections Sunday, a daily high.

The resurgence of the coronavirus in the U.S.\u2014which reported more than 60,000 new cases Sunday\u2014also has the potential to squeeze oil consumption.\n\n\u201cThe recent demand data has pretty much universally been in one direction, which is disappointing,\u201d said Emily Ashford, energy analyst at Standard Chartered Bank.

The Italian company handed the British pounds to JPMorgan, which exchanged them for \u20ac553 million in a transaction known as a cross-currency basis swap, where one party borrows currency from another and lends its own currency in return.\n\nThe bank believes it is the first such structure to incorporate promises both sides have made on the environment.\n\n\u201cWe think this swap could very much be a template for other transactions to follow, not just in the swap market, but also in other markets for FX and rates,\u201d said Johannes Banner, JPMorgan\u2019s head of European corporate foreign exchange and rates sales.\n\nThe energy company and the bank will pay interest to each other on the borrowed money every six months. That interest cost can rise if either side doesn\u2019t make good on plans they have set to become more environmentally friendly. JPMorgan declined to comment on the specific changes to the expense in the contract should the bank or its client fail to meet their targets. Enel said both parties would face a financial penalty, without giving details.\n\nThe deal is the latest example of Wall Street\u2019s efforts to tap skyrocketing demand for financial products linked to environmental, social and governance goals, as investors try to do good while also making money. While it is still a tiny corner of the broader market, its rapid growth has caught the attention of some of the world\u2019s largest financial institutions.\n\nFlows into so-called ESG funds hit a record in the second quarter of this year, more than doubling from the previous quarter to $54.6 billion, according to Morningstar.\n\nA point of controversy has been that there still aren\u2019t regulations to determine what constitutes a sustainable investment. This has led to concerns about whether issuers and investors could be exaggerating their claims about being environmentally friendly or raising money on the back of commitments they would have made anyway, a phenomenon known as greenwashing.\n\nRelated Video Investors propelled ESG funds to new heights in 2020, and federal agencies are watching.\n\nEnel\u2019s green targets are linked to the amount of renewable energy it generates.

{"Dunkin' Buyout Talks Will Fuel Deal Hunger": [["Dunkin' Buyout Talks Will Fuel Deal Hunger", "Shareholders across the restaurant industry got some welcome news: Private equity wants to eat.\n\nDunkin\u2019 Brands Group, DNKN 16.12% which owns Dunkin\u2019 and Baskin-Robbins, said Sunday it has held preliminary discussions to be acquired by private-equity backed Inspire Brands. Dunkin shares rallied 16% on Monday and have returned about 250% since their March low.\n\nDunkin, which primarily sells breakfast food, has been hit hard by commuting changes during the coronavirus pandemic. In 2019, 58% of Dunkin\u2019s total U.S. system sales came from coffee and other beverages. Second-quarter comparable sales fell 18.7% at U.S. stores. That decline would have been nearly 5 percentage points larger if temporarily closed stores were included. Comparable sales at U.S. Baskin-Robbins locations fell by 6% in the quarter. Overseas locations for both fared even worse.\n\nThird-quarter results, due out on Thursday, should be much improved. But Inspire, which owns brands such as Arby\u2019s, Sonic and Jimmy John\u2019s, isn\u2019t getting its coffee at a discount, even assuming a return to pre-pandemic normalcy. Based on 2022 free cash flow estimates from analysts at Wedbush Securities, Dunkin sports a rich multiple of 30 times.\n\nDunkin\u2019s long-term outlook certainly is strong. It has fewer than 10,000 U.S. stores\u2014a much smaller presence than Starbucks or McDonald\u2019s. The pandemic and government restrictions on gathering have devastated small independent restaurants and coffee shops and many won\u2019t recover. The National Restaurant Association estimates that 100,000 independent restaurants will close this year, which would be more than double a normal year\u2019s tally. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising if next year is challenging for independents. That should translate into major expansion opportunities for larger players such as Dunkin\u2019.\n\nFurthermore, coffee and beverage sales have better profit margins than the vast majority of quick-service restaurant products. Dunkin\u2019 locations don\u2019t require much real estate to operate, which makes expansion easier. It doesn\u2019t hurt that Dunkin\u2019 runs a fully franchised business model, which is less risky for the parent company than owning the stores outright.\n\nInvestors should expect more restaurant deals. Private-equity firms are loaded with cash and can borrow as cheaply as ever. Restaurants, which make heavy use of debt financing, are a natural target. And if a lingering pandemic won\u2019t scare off suitors, high prices probably won\u2019t either."], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}
{"ETF Clones Multiply in Industry Fee War": [["ETF Clones Multiply in Industry Fee War", "The race to zero on Wall Street is so competitive that some of the biggest asset managers are creating cheaper knockoffs of their most popular exchange-traded funds.\n\nInvesco Ltd. IVZ -1.36% was the latest firm to create a copycat of one of its own ETFs. Earlier this month, it launched the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF, a near carbon copy of the biggest tech-focused ETF in the world, the Invesco QQQ Trust, better known as the Qs for its QQQ ticker symbol. Both funds track an index of the 100 biggest Nasdaq stocks, a corner of the stock market that has massively outperformed in recent years.\n\nBut there is one glaring difference between the ETFs: fees.\n\nQQQ charges investors 0.2%, meaning for every $1,000 investors put into the ETF they pay $2 in annual fees. The copycat, which goes by the ticker symbol QQQM, charges 0.15%, and shares cost half as much.\n\nThe move would have been unthinkable a decade ago. Asset managers risk cannibalizing their most popular products by redirecting assets into other funds, analysts said. But Invesco and other executives in the ETF industry say the copycat ETFs are necessary to compete with rivals that are all seeking the attention\u2014and cash\u2014of cost-conscious individual investors.\n\nThere are more than 2,200 exchange-traded products listed on major U.S. exchanges, but the cheapest products tracking broad swaths of the stock market have attracted the lion\u2019s share of investors\u2019 cash. In a recent report, Morningstar found that investors last year put $581 billion in the cheapest 20% of ETFs and mutual funds, while the rest saw $224 billion in outflows.\n\nAnd analysts say the trend is continuing to play out.\n\nAsset managers have noted the preference, sparking a fee war that has dramatically reshaped how much investors pay for investment products.\n\nRivals BlackRock Inc., BLK -2.37% Vanguard Group, State Street Corp. STT -2.76% , Invesco and others have all slashed fees on some of their most popular products. The fee war has ultimately saved investors some $388 million this year compared with what they would have been paying back in December, according to FactSet.\n\nSome retail investors prioritize low fees, said John Hoffman, Invesco\u2019s head of Americas, ETFs and indexed strategies. \u201cThis is something we heard from individual investors, and this [QQQM] should help solve that.\u201d\n\nBut some ETFs can\u2019t get any cheaper, giving rise to clones such as QQQM.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Markets A pre-markets primer packed with news, trends and ideas. Plus, up-to-the-minute market data. PREVIEW\n\nQQQ, which was first launched by Nasdaq in 1999, is structured as a unit investment trust, which comes with a higher operating cost than a plain-vanilla ETF, along with other limitations. The fund doesn\u2019t have the ability to reinvest dividends or engage in lending securities to short sellers. The latter helps generate some extra revenue for ETFs, helping to mitigate some of the cost for investors.\n\nDespite those constraints, QQQ has accumulated $141 billion in assets and is one of the most traded securities in the world. That makes it a staple for big institutional investors who give priority to getting in and out of positions seamlessly over cost. But its fee relative to other, cheaper ETFs might be a turnoff for mom-and-pop savers, Invesco executives said.\n\n\u201cQQQM with its lower management fee may appeal to long-term buy-and-hold investors,\u201d added John Feyerer, Invesco\u2019s senior director of equity ETF strategy.\n\nState Street did something similar with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, the world\u2019s biggest ETF and the first ever launched. Also structured as a unit investment trust, State Street executives had run into the same limitations as Invesco. Worse, investors in recent years have plowed more money into similar, cheaper versions of SPY, the ticker symbol for State Street\u2019s fund, run by rivals BlackRock and Vanguard.\n\n\u201c \u2018QQQM with its lower management fee may appeal to long-term buy-and-hold investors.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 John Feyerer, Invesco\u2019s senior director of equity ETF strategy\n\nTo remain competitive with individual investors, State Street in January switched the index tracked by one of its smaller funds, the SPDR Portfolio Large-Cap ETF, to the S&P 500, essentially making an ETF copy of SPY under the ticker SPLG. SPLG\u2019s fee is 0.03%, compared with SPY\u2019s 0.09%.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re acknowledging that we have diverse users among our clients who have different need-sets,\u201d said Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street. Mr. Bartolini added that shares of SPLG trade for less than SPY, giving investors an easier access point.\n\nNot long after the index change, SPLG, the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF, began attracting assets more quickly, more than doubling in size to nearly $7 billion, according to FactSet. That is still a sliver of SPY, which has more than $300 billion in assets.\n\nStill, analysts predict clone ETFs will continue to gather assets as investors and money managers catch on to the products.\n\nEric Reinhold, a financial adviser at Ameriprise Financial Services LLC in Orlando, Fla., who puts most of his clients in ETFs, says he plans to start tracking the lower-cost generic funds as replacements for the originals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m all about lowering overall fees for clients,\u201d Mr. Reinhold said.\n\nWrite to Michael Wursthorn at Michael.Wursthorn@wsj.com"], "10/27/2020, 12:56:14"]}
{"Break Up Big Tech Earnings": [["Break Up Big Tech Earnings", "Is there excessive concentration among America\u2019s biggest technology companies? In at least one respect, the answer is undoubtedly yes.\n\nApple, AAPL 0.01% Amazon.com, AMZN 0.08% Facebook, FB -2.70% Twitter TWTR -2.85% and Alphabet GOOG -3.08% all are set to report third-quarter earnings on the afternoon of Thursday, Oct. 29. Many of these companies tend to report on the same day, but having all five at once is new: Alphabet originally was scheduled to release its earnings on Monday, but last week said it would move the announcement to Thursday. Making matters worse, Twitter normally hosts its call in the morning, but this quarter will do so in the afternoon. Neither company gave a reason for the change.\n\nOther industries also tend to group their earnings together, but not to quite the same degree. In banking, for instance, JPMorgan Chase JPM -2.48% and Citigroup C -1.57% both reported their third-quarter earnings on Oct 13. But others, including Bank of America BAC -1.45% and Goldman Sachs, GS -1.90% went later that week. While it isn\u2019t exactly the most pressing issue facing the industry, this close grouping of earnings announcements isn\u2019t victimless. Investors, analysts and journalists pay close attention to earnings announcements and their associated quarterly conference calls. Holding all these disclosures at the same time gives interested parties less time to parse the information being disclosed, thus harming transparency and market efficiency. Spreading out their announcements would be an investor-friendly move that would cost the companies exactly nothing. They should consider it.

Ant could raise up to a maximum of about $5.2 billion more, if underwriters exercise their option to purchase up to 15% more shares in an arrangement known as a green shoe.\n\nThose sums would eclipse the $25 billion raised in 2014 by its former parent Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and the $29.4 billion of shares sold more recently by Saudi Aramco, in what is to date the largest-ever IPO.\n\nThe price values the Hangzhou-based group at about $313 billion, after including the new capital raised but before any green shoe. In comparison, Mastercard Inc. was worth about $330 billion as of Friday\u2019s close. A private fundraising in 2018 valued Ant at $150 billion.\n\nJack Ma, who controls Ant, said over the weekend the IPO will be \u201cthe largest in human history.\u201d Speaking at a financial forum in Shanghai on Saturday, he said: \u201cThis is the first time that such a big IPO was priced outside of New York City, which we wouldn\u2019t have dared to think about five, or even three years ago.\u201d\n\nIn a few years, Ant has helped change how people in China spend, borrow, save and invest. The firm, which has its origins in an escrow service for Alibaba\u2019s e-commerce websites, now processes trillions of dollars in payments annually, runs one of the world\u2019s largest money-market funds, and facilitates small loans to hundreds of millions of consumers and small businesses.\n\n\u201cThis company has single-handedly modernized China\u2019s financial infrastructure,\u201d said Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nChinese fintech titan Ant Group is seeking to raise more than $34 billion in what is due to be the world\u2019s biggest-ever initial public offering. WSJ explains how Ant\u2019s backbone service, Alipay, has revolutionized payments and investing in China. Photo Composite: Crystal Tai\n\nAs it has grown, Ant has drawn attention from banks and authorities. Financial regulators pressured Ant to tame the growth of its giant money-market mutual fund, Yu\u2019e Bao, which was originally created to enable users of its mobile payments app, Alipay, to earn returns on spare cash in their digital wallets. Ant\u2019s earlier ambition of developing a credit-scoring system was also thwarted by China\u2019s central bank.\n\nIn recent years, Ant has emphasized its focus on technology, dropping the term \u201cfinancial services\u201d from its name. It has positioned itself as a partner for banks that helps assess credit risk and offers lenders access to its more than 700 million monthly active users in China.\n\nIts Hong Kong stock will start trading on Nov. 5, according to a filing with that city\u2019s stock exchange. Although Ant didn\u2019t provide a Shanghai listing date yet, it is expected to be on the same day.\n\nBankers have been rushing to price Ant\u2019s IPO before the U.S. election to get ahead of potential market volatility, according to investors who attended roadshows. The State Department recently proposed to an interagency panel that Ant be put on a trade blacklist.\n\nThe deal is the first concurrent listing in Shanghai and Hong Kong for a decade, and the largest listing to date on Shanghai\u2019s fledgling Science and Technology Innovation Board, a Nasdaq-style board that is also known as the STAR Market. Inside Ant, the code name for the IPO was \u201cProject Star.\u201d\n\nNewsletter Sign-up Markets Alert Major financial-market and trading news. PREVIEW\n\nAnt has already finished selling shares in Shanghai, with 80% of the offering going to so-called strategic investors, who will commit to hold the shares for at least 12 or 24 months. That proportion is a record for the STAR Market. Investors seeking to buy the remaining 20% of shares in Shanghai placed orders exceeding the stock on offer by more than 284 times, according to its filing.\n\nOn Monday, shares were already oversubscribed less than an hour after the order book was open for institutional investors in the Hong Kong leg of the IPO, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nStrategic investors in the Shanghai shares include China\u2019s national pension fund, and a slew of investment funds affiliated with China\u2019s state-owned firms, insurance companies and banks, as well as mutual funds.\n\nForeign buyers include Singaporean state investors GIC Private Ltd. and Temasek Fullerton Alpha Pte. Ltd., the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority.\n\nAlibaba will also buy 51.1 billion yuan worth of shares, equivalent to $7.6 billion, to maintain its stake at around one-third of Ant. Mr. Ma and members of Ant\u2019s top management will collectively own 39.5% of Ant after the IPO, before the exercise of any green shoe.\n\nThe record-breaking deal will bring in hefty fees for a number of investment banks. Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley and China International Capital Corp. have top billing as joint sponsors of Ant\u2019s Hong Kong IPO, while CICC and China Securities Co. are joint sponsors of the Shanghai share sale.
