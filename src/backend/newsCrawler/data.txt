{"Some Companies Make Their Websites More Elderly-Friendly": [["Some Companies Make Their Websites More Elderly-Friendly", "Text that is difficult to see clearly. Small buttons that are hard to select. Key content hidden behind confusing icons.\n\nThese are just some of the reasons why many older adults with deteriorating vision and dexterity say they struggle to navigate the internet, an issue that has come into sharper focus recently as the pandemic forces more people to take care of business online than ever before.\n\nThis was an issue, of course, well before the pandemic, and some companies had already started to redesign their websites to better serve seniors. While most of these firms provide products and services that cater to older adults, some consultants and designers say the changes they are making could soon be embraced more broadly, as the senior population\u2014and its buying power\u2014grows.\n\n\u201cThe economy is shifting,\u201d says London-based designer John Corcoran, who predicts that companies will become increasingly attuned to the needs of the baby-boom population when designing apps and websites.\n\nA U.K. study from Beyond Consultancy, a design-and-technology consulting firm, and Savanta Group Ltd., a marketing-research firm, found that 58% of people age 65 and over say they have increased their use of technology over the past six months, but only 42% of the same group say they find technology straightforward to use and 13% say they find going online a frustrating experience.\n\nSeniors will quickly abandon a company website that is inaccessible to them, which\u2014in a pandemic-driven time of online services and commerce\u2014equates to abandoning the company, says Nick Rappolt, the chief executive officer of Beyond.\n\nImportance of contrast\n\nAndrea Cosindas, a 73-year-old former teacher from Holbrook, Mass., goes online once a week to check her email, bank accounts and work intranet at Nordstrom.com, where she is employed part time. Sometimes she reads the news online or uses the Waze app on her phone for driving directions.\n\nOther than that, she avoids the internet because she often finds it hard to use.\n\n\u201cMy vision has gotten worse over the years, so the font on my phone is often too little to see, but using the computer at home is less convenient,\u201d Ms. Cosindas says. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s hard to distinguish between the period and comma. And it\u2019s also really frustrating when I ask Siri something and she can\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying.\u201d\n\nApparently she isn\u2019t alone. A 2017 study from the Pew Research Center found only 26% of internet users ages 65 and over were \u201cvery confident\u201d when using computers, smartphones or other electronic devices. Older people who reported health problems, disabilities or handicaps were less likely to use the internet at all, the report found.\n\nPrescription-discount company SingleCare, which is owned by Boston-based RxSense LLC, has been gradually redesigning its website to better serve the needs of users 50 and older since its launch in 2015. Research from focus groups found older people like it best when they complete a task on the site in three steps or less, says Alex Zaky, senior vice president of product, who is based in New York City.\n\n\u201cAs a result, we\u2019ve streamlined our navigation, simplified nomenclature with user-friendly terminology and increased sizes of buttons for ease of use,\u201d he says.\n\nThe SingleCare website has been adjusted visually, too. Any fields where users need to input text are white, so they\u2019re clear and easy to see, and important text has been made bigger, Mr. Zaky says.\n\nText size that is smaller than 12 points is difficult for those with imperfect vision to read, says Mr. Corcoran, the London designer. Sans serif fonts are preferable to serif type, too, he says, because the small strokes added to the end of a serif letter or symbol can \u201cbreak up\u201d in the eyes of someone with deteriorating eyesight. Websites should make sure not to lock things down or place text on the page as an image file, he adds. \u201cThe end user needs to be able to resize, recolor and change the font based on their own individual needs,\u201d he says.\n\nArguably the biggest help for those struggling to read information up close is contrast, says Jonathan Hassell, founder and CEO of Hassell Inclusion, an accessibility consulting firm based in London. The yellow and black used in international airport signage works well as a high-contrast text and background color pairing, he says; SingleCare opted for a high-contrast palette of white, purple, pink and a bright lime green.\n\nAuriens Ltd., a luxury London senior-living development set to open in 2021, also opted for a pared-down website that gives priority to clear signposting of information. Rather than hiding section links in a drop-down menu, the site displays all of its navigation options on a sidebar.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about being logical,\u201d says David Meagher, CEO of Auriens. \u201cConsistency is important.\u201d\n\nThe use of bright, bold colors is central to the design of Ageist, a media platform founded in 2015 for those over 50.\n\nAgeist says its website, which is updated frequently to improve the user experience, is designed for easy navigation: Menu items are displayed clearly at the top of the home page, and the site requires no more than a few scrolls to reach the bottom. Websites with infinite scrolling, whereby a user can never reach the \u201cend\u201d of a site\u2019s content, aren\u2019t popular among older people, says the platform\u2019s 65-year-old founder, David Stewart.\n\nA linear, clearly signposted design, akin to that of a newspaper, is the format in which they want to consume information, he says. And the idea of spending hours on the internet in the hopes of finding something cool isn\u2019t appealing to many in Mr. Stewart\u2019s age group, he says. \u201cWe\u2019re not that amused by going down a rabbit hole of discovery,\u201d he says.\n\n\u2018Fiddly\u2019\n\nSo why haven\u2019t more companies changed their websites to accommodate seniors, given the size and buying power of the audience? The problem isn\u2019t the complexity of the design, says Mr. Hassell. It is the complexity of the audience and their manifold needs.\n\nMany designers know they need to accommodate users with extreme forms of disability, Mr. Hassell says. What they don\u2019t often consider is the experience of those living with several mild but limiting impairments\u2014the subtle, multipronged deterioration of things like near vision and dexterity that often comes with age.\n\nAccessibility legislation, like the Americans with Disabilities Act, and organized accessibility campaigns similarly concentrate on the needs of people with severe disabilities such as blindness, rather than multiple minor impairments, such as those older people have, he says. What\u2019s more, he says, older people often don\u2019t have the technical language needed to formally complain about their issues online.\n\n\u201cWhat they normally do is describe things with words like \u2018fiddly,\u2019 when what they mean is something has been designed for someone with a lot more dexterity or precision than them,\u201d he says.\n\nStill, Mr. Hassell says he expects calls for a better web for seniors to grow as the demographic gets larger and older adults leverage social media to articulate their demands en masse. \u201cLegislation can help,\u201d he says, but it\u2019s really \u201cabout getting the CEOs and information officers of all companies to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nEasy on the Eyes\n\nTo accommodate seniors, companies such as Auriens, a London senior-living development, are designing websites to be easier to read and navigate.\n\nRather than hiding links in a dropdown menu, site displays navigation options on a sidebar section.

{"West Coast Farmers Had a Hellish Summer. It Might Not Be an Aberration.": [["West Coast Farmers Had a Hellish Summer. It Might Not Be an Aberration.", "Larry Tristano is looking out over what used to be his lush 13-acre farm in Santa Rosa, California. Less than a month ago, the fields were full, and he and his small team at Triple T Farm were harvesting cherry tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, and squash.\n\nNow, there\u2019s nothing but burnt ground. On Sept. 27, two raging Northern California wildfires, the Glass and Shady fires, converged, rapidly burning thousands of acres. The family homes on the property\u2014where he and two more generations of his family lived\u2014were burnt into ash; so were the barns, tools, livestock, an SUV and more. \u201cAfter the fires in Paradise, I drove through and said, \u2018I feel so sorry for these people.\u2019 But you\u2019ll never know how anybody feels until you\u2019ve gone through it,\u201d Tristano says, choking back tears. \u201cIt\u2019s just horrible.\u201d\n\nUp and down the West Coast, farmers are reeling from a hellish summer of consecutive and overlapping crises. First, COVID-19 spread across the country, endangering the lives of farmworkers who were deemed as essential and devastating the restaurant market. Record-breaking hot stretches, which made this August the hottest one on record in California, burnt crops and decreased yields. Then a new wave of fires descended across the forests and hills, displacing workers, demolishing homes and blanketing regions with stifling smoke. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to put the best food on the table and it\u2019s been very, very rough,\u201d Tristano says.\n\nWhile some might chalk up these events to a series of freakish aberrations, there are signs that none of these crises will disappear anytime soon. Climate change is facilitating record-breaking heat spells; fires are raging every season in part due to poor forest management; many employers are resigned to COVID-19 lingering through the start of next year\u2019s planting season. Once a land of bounty, the Golden State has turned into an unrelenting minefield of obstacles that have exposed the many flaws of an entire ecosystem.\n\nAs West Coast farmers and farmworkers start thinking about long-term solutions, they are often stumped. \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on \u2018How I get through today,\u2019 but this might be what California looks like every August and September,\u201d says Lorraine Walker, who runs Eatwell Farms in Dixon, California. \u201cI have spoken with a few farmers and asked them, \u2018What are you planning? Everyone\u2019s response is, \u2018We don\u2019t really know.'\u201d\n\nA volunteer with GleanSLO organizes strawberries in a bin at a farm in San Luis Obispo, Calif., on June 4, 2020. Before the pandemic, GleanSLO volunteers typically gleaned from backyard fruit trees\u2014now they visit farms. Jenna Schoenefeld\u2014The New York Times/Redux\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s \u201cRollercoaster Ride\u201d\n\nThe agricultural output of the West Coast is massive. California\u2019s Central Valley grows a staggering quarter of the nation\u2019s food and 40% of its fruits, nuts and other table foods. Oregon raked in $238 million in 2019 from wine, while Washington produces 65% of the nation\u2019s fresh apples. If you buy a piece of produce from your typical American supermarket, there\u2019s a good chance it came from a West Coast farm.\n\nBut the state of farms in the United States was precarious even before COVID-19 struck earlier this year and plunged the nation into a recession. In 2019, the number of farms filing for bankruptcy increased 24% from the previous year, while the U.S. farm debt grew to $425 billion. Foreign competition, trade wars, regulations and unpredictable weather made life hard on farmers. In California, massive wildfires ripped through expanses of fields that grow wine grapes, tomatoes and other goods.\n\nCOVID-19 added a new chaotic layer of unpredictability. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rollercoaster ride, from panic buying to loss of demand to the food service business disappearing,\u201d says Joe Pezzini, the president and CEO of Ocean Mist Farms, which is based in Castroville, Calif. \u201cEvery day\u2019s been a new challenge.\u201d Some farms took a huge hit from the loss of critical buyers like restaurants and school systems; others were buoyed by the increased interest in home cooking with fresh produce. The decreased price of many crops hit some farmers hard; others were able to float through thanks to government loans. As farmers realized they had excess supply, they dumped milk, slaughtered livestock and smashed eggs.\n\nRegardless of COVID\u2019s impact on a farm\u2019s bottom line, the workforce bore the brunt of the risk. There are 400,000 agricultural workers in California, a population that was deemed essential during the pandemic. Researchers and advocates estimate between 60% and 75% of them are undocumented, and a majority are Latinos. Their typical lack of unionization and the constant fear of deportation have long made them vulnerable to workplace coercion. \u201cThe inequities that COVID-19 has highlighted, they existed pre-COVID,\u201d Estella Cisneros, the legal director of the Agricultural Worker Program at California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of pressure on farmworkers to continue working, and a lot of fear of retaliation.\u201d\n\nThis year, Cisneros says that her office has fielded many complaints from California farmworkers who say their employers are not taking proactive steps to protect them or are simply ignoring Cal/OSHA regulations about protective equipment. \u201cSome workers said that instead of being given masks, they were given something that much more resembled hairnets,\u201d she says.\n\nMany of the farmworkers that the CRLA assists are part of an aging population, have preexisting conditions like heart disease and diabetes, and have little access to healthcare or job alternatives. Harrowing statistics have confirmed how vulnerable Latino populations are to the virus: In California, they represent 61.1% of COVID-19 cases and 48.6% of deaths, despite making up only 38.9% of the population. \u201cIt\u2019s highlighted how at the mercy these workers are at the hands of people who are not the workers themselves,\u201d Cisneros says.\n\nIn Oregon, Reyna Lopez, the executive director of the farmworker union PCUN (Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste), says that a quarter of farmworkers polled in a member phone survey said they hadn\u2019t seen any improvements in safety measures being taken by employers. \u201cWe\u2019ve also heard that enforcement of the rules isn\u2019t good\u2014and when there is a complaint, people aren\u2019t seeing it getting investigated,\u201d she says.\n\nLopez and Cisneros are both fighting for the extensions of OSHA regulations related to COVID-19 in their states. They worry that the virus will continue to spread through vulnerable communities if workers are kept in packed labor housing units and sent out into the fields and processing plants in unsafe conditions, especially once the season picks back up next spring. \u201cWe have to be ready for May, when we\u2019ll see lots of people coming for the harvest,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cThis year, that\u2019s when we saw a lot of outbreaks.\u201d\n\nWorkers pick corn in the pre-dawn hours to avoid the heat of the day in California's San Joaquin Valley on Aug. 21, 2020. Brian L. Frank\u2014The New York Times/Redux\n\nA Record-Breaking Heat Wave\n\nSome farm owners have viciously complained about regulations like a rising minimum wage and water restrictions, saying they are squeezing their already meager margin of profit. \u201cThe costs are becoming so exorbitant, you\u2019re seeing a lot of ground be idle or sold to other growers,\u201d says Bruce Blodgett, the executive director of the San Joaquin Farm Bureau Federation. \u201cPeople seem to forget we compete in a world marketplace that doesn\u2019t have the labor or regulatory costs we do. Farmers are saying, \u2018I\u2019ve had enough, I can\u2019t compete.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhile Blodgett and others fight a battle over regulation, they\u2019re also getting hammered by increasingly chaotic weather systems. Blodgett says that heavy rains during cherry harvest season in May slashed the potential cherry revenue in half. Then a record-breaking scorching summer set in, threatening both the crops and the ability of farmworkers to work in the face of heat exhaustion. In August, nearly 14,000 lightning strikes hit California over a 72-hour period. In early September, L.A. County hit an unprecedented 121 degrees.\n\nSome 300 miles north of Los Angeles on the central coast of California lies Taylor Farms, which produces salads and vegetable kits and racks up billions a year in total sales. For the last two decades, Taylor Farms\u2019 crops have thrived in the moderate climate of Salinas, where the coastal breeze and fog suppress summer temperatures and allow leafy greens to thrive.\n\nBut this year, record high temperatures hit Salinas once again, forcing Taylor Farms into a work schedule they\u2019ve never tried before: complete night shifts, with workers reporting at midnight and working through 6 or 7 in the morning. \u201cWe kept people as cool as we could. At the same time, it was an awful rough six weeks for everybody who\u2019s in this business,\u201d Mark Borman, the president of Taylor Farms California, says. Despite the change, Borman says the company has lost about 23% of its projected yield over the last four weeks due to the heat wave.\n\nOcean Mist Farms, which specializes in artichokes and brussels sprouts and operates in the same area, was similarly impacted. \u201cLettuce gets burn on it, and there may be a supply issue coming up for Thanksgiving,\u201d Pezzini, the CEO and president, says. \u201cYou have to salvage what you can.\u201d\n\nBigger companies like Taylor Farms and Ocean Mist have some flexibility to deal with climate change: they can simply alter or move their operations. Pezzini hopes to move his artichokes and brussels sprouts closer to the coast where it\u2019s cooler, and has been using drip irrigation in order to combat the water drought plaguing the state. Borman is looking at his options outside the state entirely. \u201cToday, we grow more and more lettuce in Central Mexico. We\u2019re growing more in Colorado,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to diversify our growing regions, so as things continue to change, we\u2019ll have the right development from a seed perspective and have some flexibility.\u201d\n\nBut smaller farmers aren\u2019t afforded the same adaptability. Walker, at Eatwell Farms, says her tomato crop was \u201cbeyond disappointing\u201d this year due to the combination of an extremely hot August followed by weeks of smoke blocking the sun. She says she might plant her tomatoes earlier in the season when it\u2019s cooler\u2014but that would impact the planting of her winter crops before it. \u201cWe don\u2019t have much wiggle room,\u201d she says.\n\nThe view from Shimanek Bridge Farm near Scio, Ore., when wildfires swept through the area in September. Courtesy Kendra Kimbrauskas\n\n\u201cThe Sun Didn\u2019t Rise\u201d\n\nWhile rising temperatures threaten livelihoods, they mostly don\u2019t threaten actual lives. But the fires that follow the heat waves do. Over five million acres have burned in California, Oregon and Washington combined during what has been the most active fire year ever on the West Coast. Experts say that climate change, lightning strikes and poor forest management have combined to provide the kindling for infernos that have killed over thirty people and destroyed thousands of buildings.\n\nKendra Kimbrauskas, the co-owner Shimanek Bridge Farm near Scio, Oregon, had previously not thought much about the risk of fires when in September, she woke up to a strange sight. \u201cThe sun didn\u2019t rise. It was black like it was midnight,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThe ash was falling, and it looked like it was in the middle of winter, with snowflakes in your headlights. At like 11 a.m., the sun finally came through and turned everything a really eerie red\u2014like blood red.\u201d\n\nKimbrauskas hooked up her horse trailer and headed to the county fairgrounds, where she stayed for almost a week. While her farm was ultimately untouched by the fires, many were not\u2014and she dove into a community rescue effort to save the many animals that had been left behind. She ended up using her truck and a trailer to transport abandoned animals to the Linn County Expo Center, where a noisy scene was developing. \u201cWe\u2019re talking hundreds of farms, thousands of animals,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like Noah\u2019s Ark, with any animal you can imagine that people were scrambling to get out of danger: horses, sheep, bunnies, ducks, geese, alpacas.\u201d\n\nKimbrauskas says she has committed to regenerative farming practices that will hopefully lead to more fire-resilient farms. But this experience has shown her how even the best preventative measures may not be enough. \u201cWe also have to be prepared to just leave,\u201d she says. \u201cIf we don\u2019t have a plan, we may lose our lives.\u201d\n\nJulio Hernandez cuts the hair of his brother, Alvaro Hernandez, at a farm that opened space to people displaced by wildfires in Central Point, Ore., on Sept. 26, 2020. The Almeda Fire leveled some of the only affordable housing for the immigrants who work the fields, kitchens and construction sites of southern Oregon. Amanda Lucier\u2014The New York Times/Redux\n\nLopez, of PCUN, said that many farmworkers in areas adjacent to evacuation zones were still told to go back to work and endure hazardous air quality. \u201cIt\u2019s really important for people to understand there were thousands of outdoor farmworkers still out there working while this was still happening,\u201d she says. \u201cWe spoke to a farmworker, Manuel, who said that during the peak of the wildfires, he was feeling nauseated, had a headache, and his body was hurting. He\u2019s still not feeling 100%.\u201d\n\nMany more lost their homes. In Phoenix, Ore., about 200 miles south of Scio, a wildfire ripped through a predominantly Latino community, destroying nearly 1,000 housing units, most of them mobile homes and RV parks. Many members of the community are agricultural workers who toil at the area\u2019s food processing plants and wineries, and have nowhere to turn. \u201cIn less than five minutes, everything was gone,\u201d Phoenix resident Jairo Gomez told the Washington Post.\n\nLarry Tristano, in Santa Rosa, suffered the same fate. He himself was in Wyoming when the fire rolled through\u2014but his family was still in their Santa Rosa house and scrambled to get out when they learned of the evacuation order. \u201cMy wife grabbed our parents\u2019 wedding pictures, her mother\u2019s scrapbooks, personal things, clothes, our dogs, and that was it,\u201d he says.\n\nTwo days later, Tristano returned to nothing. \u201cThe only thing that survived was one greenhouse and the tractor. Everything else is gone,\u201d he says. In response, he started doing the only thing he knows how to do: farming the land. \u201cWe got a generator. We hooked up the well. Our vegetable crops did survive, and we\u2019re actually back at the market on a limited supply. We\u2019re not going to let this beat us.\u201d Over two weeks, over $29,000 has been raised on GoFundMe for the farm\u2019s workers and its recovery.\n\nGround scorched by the Glass Fire leads to an untouched vineyard along Silverado Trail in Calistoga, Calif., on Sept. 29, 2020. Jessica Christian\u2014The San Francisco Chronicle/Getty Images\n\nWhile Tristano is plowing ahead, there are many signs that the triple crisis for West Coast farmers is far from over. In Washington, the apple crop will be up to 10% smaller than expected due to wildfires and extreme windstorms battering orchards. Economic recovery has been slow, and COVID-19 could very well be lingering when many farm workers return in full force to plant seeds in the spring, threatening their health and slowing down schedules. And federal assistance has been underwhelming: while President Trump has spearheaded record farm subsidies, most of the money has flowed to Southern states and big farms, a nonpartisan watchdog agency found.\n\nBorman, of Taylor Farms, says these compounding issues could affect the consumer through higher prices or a decreased selection. Restaurants may start building their menus around less perishable greens, like cabbage or iceberg lettuce, to protect against volatility. He expects some farmers to move out of the region to greener pastures, \u201cwhether that be into central Mexico or even further south into South America.\u201d\n\nAs far as how West Coast farmers are adapting to these looming struggles, Borman doesn\u2019t have an answer. \u201cIt was a really tricky year. There\u2019s a lot of uncertainty, but I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a lot of strategy coming out of it yet,\u201d he says. \u201cHonestly, everybody\u2019s a little shell-shocked right now.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.

{"Pet Owners Are Diverse, but Veterinarians Are Overwhelmingly White. Black Veterinarians Want to Change That": [["Pet Owners Are Diverse, but Veterinarians Are Overwhelmingly White. Black Veterinarians Want to Change That", "As a child, Tierra Price was mesmerized by Dr. Dolittle, portrayed by Eddie Murphy in the 1998 film\u2014not only because he could talk to dogs and sad circus tigers, but because he was a person of color who treated animals. \u201cThat resonated deeply with me,\u201d says Price, who wore an oversized white coat and carried around a stuffed Dalmatian for her first-grade career day. \u201cI grew up thinking that I was going to be one of the first Black veterinarians because I had never seen any,\u201d says Price, now 26.\n\nThere were no Black doctors at vet clinics near her Louisville, Ky. home or at the local animal shelter where she volunteered. Price didn\u2019t see her first real Black veterinarian until she was 19 and participating in a veterinary program for minority undergraduates. By the time she started veterinary school, she felt like an outcast. In 2018, Price created an online networking group for Black vets just to connect and commiserate with people who looked like her. \u201cI was going into a profession I didn\u2019t really belong in,\u201d she says.\n\nYears later, not much has changed. Veterinarians are projected to be among the most in-demand workers in the next decade. As more people of all races own pets, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) predicts jobs for vets and vet technicians will grow 16% by 2029. Nearly 65% of white households have pets, 61% of Hispanic households have pets, and almost 37% of Black households have pets, according to the most recent industry data. Yet pet lovers are faced with a predominantly white world once it\u2019s time to see a vet. Of the more than 104,000 veterinarians in the nation, nearly 90% are white, less than 2% are Hispanic and almost none are Black, according to 2019 BLS figures.\n\n\"In this day and time, you don't stay that way unless you're ignorant to the fact that diversity is good.\"\n\nThis spring, Kimberley Glover spent nearly two months searching for a Black veterinarian in Birmingham, Ala., to care for her 2-year-old puppy Stokely\u2014named after civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael\u2014and to serve as a role model for her two children, who attend predominantly white schools. After scouring the internet and Facebook groups for Black pet owners, she finally received a suggestion from a college classmate, but the clinic was too far away.\n\n\u201cI have given up the search, honestly,\u201d says Glover, 46. \u201cIt just tells me there\u2019s more work to do.\u201d Price, who graduated from the Virginia-Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine in May and is now a veterinarian in Los Angeles, agrees. \u201cWe have so much catching up to do,\u201d she says.\n\nStark disparities have permeated the vet world for decades, advocates say, long before George Floyd\u2019s death in May sparked a national movement for racial justice. In 2013, the profession was dubbed the whitest in America. \u201cIt has always been a problem,\u201d says Annie J. Daniel, who founded the nonprofit National Association for Black Veterinarians (NABV). \u201cThis was just the wake-up call.\u201d\n\nDespite youth outreach efforts at schools and community partnerships to grow the number of Black veterinarians, the group has barely moved the needle since it was formed in 2016. In fact, the number of Black vets dropped from 2.1% of the total vet population in 2016 to below 1% in 2019, which Daniel says is largely due to systemic racism. \u201cIn this day and time, you don\u2019t stay that way unless you\u2019re ignorant to the fact that diversity is good,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cOr,\u201d she adds, \u201cyou just don\u2019t care that you\u2019re purposefully omitting a group of people.\u201d\n\nAt age 6, Price attends her first-grade career day dressed as a veterinarian. She brought a stuffed animal and made sure her name tag said DVM, \"so I wouldn't be mistaken for an MD,\" says Price. Courtesy Tierra Price\n\nMany issues prevent the veterinary profession from becoming more diverse. Chief among them is a lack of access and exposure to veterinarians at an early age, particularly among children who live in urban or low-income areas, where pet healthcare is considered more of a luxury, advocates say. \u201cIt\u2019s not that they don\u2019t want to become veterinarians,\u201d Price says, \u201cbut they don\u2019t know that it\u2019s a career option.\u201d\n\nSuch was the case for Dr. Will Draper, 53, who didn\u2019t live near vet clinics or animal shelters while growing up in a predominantly Black community in Inglewood, Calif. Differing cultural views on animals also limited his exposure to veterinarians. \u201cI didn\u2019t really have many pets growing up because my father didn\u2019t like animals,\u201d says Draper, who now runs his own practice in Decatur, Georgia with his wife. Draper loved animals, but he didn\u2019t realize he wanted to enter the field until his father took him to see the College of Veterinary Medicine at his alma mater, Tuskegee University. The historically Black college has educated more than 70% of the nation\u2019s current Black vets. Draper was hooked after one visit.\n\n\u2018Mountains and mountains of debt\u2019\n\nFor many others, getting into vet school and paying for it pose additional challenges. On top of requiring prospective students to complete a number of undergraduate prerequisite courses, which can be costly, many top vet schools require or recommend that applicants have hundreds of hours of clinical experience working with animals and licensed veterinarians. Even before the pandemic, Price says that was tough for applicants who don\u2019t live near clinics or shelters, especially if they have to work to support themselves or their families. \u201cA lot of the experience that you have to have to get into veterinary school, you\u2019re not paid for,\u201d Price says. \u201cThat really selects for populations that have the luxury of forgoing income.\u201d\n\nIn 2019, veterinary students in the U.S. graduated with an average of $150,000 in debt, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). Yet federal data shows the median annual wage for veterinarians in 2019 was about $95,000. Starting salaries were much lower. It costs graduate students attending in-state vet schools at Cornell University in New York and at the University of California, Davis upwards of $32,000 per academic year for just tuition and fees, according to the schools\u2019 websites. Tuition for Tuskegee\u2019s vet school costs more than $20,000 per semester. \u201cWhen they come out of veterinary school,\u201d Price says, \u201cthey\u2019re under mountains and mountains of debt.\u201d\n\nWhile many young veterinarians are wracked with student debt, no matter their race, daily discrimination in the workplace is another job challenge. Draper\u2014who stars in a reality TV show called Love & Vets on Disney Plus\u2014is often the first Black veterinarian his clients have ever seen. In turn, at least two have refused his service. More than 30 years ago, Draper says an older white man balked when he saw that Draper was Black. The man insisted a white doctor treat his chihuahua, Tiny, who was suffering from congestive heart failure.\n\n\u201cHe said Tiny doesn\u2019t see colored people,\u201d Draper recalls. He saved the chihuahua that day, but the man referred to Draper as \u201cthe colored doctor\u201d for the next couple of appointments. \u201cNobody would have blamed me if I told that guy to screw off,\u201d Draper says. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what it was about.\u201d When asked if clients have mistaken Draper for a technician or assistant, Draper laughs. \u201cAll the time,\u201d he says, adding that they often insist on speaking to the clinic\u2019s owner. \u201cOne time, I even said, \u2018Hold on,\u2019\u201d Draper says. \u201cI walked away and came back and said, \u2018I am the owner.\u2019\u201d\n\nDraper with Bella, a French Bulldog, at The Village Vets on Oct. 8. Bella's front leg is \"back to 100% now, fortunately,\" says Draper. Courtesy Will Draper\n\nFor Black veterinarians and pet owners, systemic racism in the industry is the norm. That\u2019s why Cheryl Kearney, 65, has no problem driving more than 50 miles to and from Detroit each time her 6-month-old kitten, Roger, needs to see a doctor. Kearney says she\u2019s had negative experiences with her own white doctors speaking to her condescendingly, assuming that because she\u2019s a Black woman, she wouldn\u2019t understand their explanations unless they dumbed them down. Kearney says she couldn\u2019t bear enduring that discomfort when it came to caring for her \u201cbaby\u201d Roger, so she made it a point to find a Black vet. \u201cIt was a much more personal experience,\u201d she says.\n\nDion Hobbs, a 46-year-old Houston financial advisor, also noticed that difference when he switched to a Black vet. Hobbs had been taking his 11-year-old dog Sadie to the same vet, who\u2019s white, for more than a decade when Sadie cut open her back leg in June\u2014her first major injury. Hobbs says he was disappointed with the clinic\u2019s bedside manner during a vulnerable and frightening time.\n\n\u201cCompetency wasn\u2019t the issue,\u201d he says. \u201cI thought there would at least be a little bit more warmth in the conversion.\u201d Hobbs says he doesn\u2019t think race played a major role in what he considered Sadie\u2019s chilly treatment, but he saw the experience as an opportunity to give his business instead to a Black veterinarian, who he says has shown more compassion. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to spend my dollars,\u201d he says, \u201cwhy not have it go to someone who looks like me?\u201d\n\nAn industry slow to change\n\nWhen an industry is stifled by homogeneity, it can breed a culture of leaders often inflexible to change, advocates say. Amid a pandemic, when social distancing restrictions limited in-person appointments, some veterinarians criticized the AVMA for not tweaking its telemedicine policy, which discourages vets from prescribing medication or diagnosing new pet patients remotely except in emergency situations. The AVMA said it does not regulate or set laws that govern the use of telemedicine, but some vets say industry leaders should be better champions for changing those laws nationwide. For some, it was the latest example that the industry was not keeping up with the times.\n\n\u201cThe veterinary industry, in general, has been very resistant to change in every facet,\u201d Price says. Since July, nearly 6,000 people have signed an online petition, written by nearly a dozen multicultural advocacy groups, calling for the AVMA to take concrete steps to assess where it stands with inclusion issues and to ensure an equitable process for all. \u201cOur profession could really benefit from more diversity because it brings creativity,\u201d Price says. \u201cIt brings innovation and it brings new ideas.\u201d\n\n\"Pets need us. People need us, and aspiring veterinarians need us to drive a change for the profession.\"\n\nIn a statement to TIME, the AVMA, which has more than 95,000 members, said it was \u201cbuilding on\u201d efforts to \u201cfurther infuse\u201d inclusion into its programs and outreach. It added that it would develop new programs to bring leaders of color to the forefront and that it would work to amplify multicultural vet advocacy groups. In July, the AVMA approved the idea of forming a commission to assess diversity issues, but it has not yet been created. \u201cTransformative change doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d says AVMA President Dr. Douglas Kratt. \u201cIt will take an industry-wide, profession-wide collaborative effort to move the needle and to attract more young people to consider a career in veterinary medicine. No single organization can do this alone.\u201d\n\nNow, amid America\u2019s racial reckoning, more leaders are pledging to step up. On Sept. 14, Banfield Pet Hospital, one of the nation\u2019s largest employers of veterinary professionals, announced it would invest $1 million in diversity efforts and ensure at least 30% of its veterinarians and support staff are people of color by 2030. \u201cThis is absolutely just the start,\u201d says Dr. Molly McAllister, Banfield\u2019s chief medical officer. Banfield also gave $125,000 to help in-need Tuskegee vet students afford their schooling. \u201cThis is a critical time,\u201d McAllister says. \u201cPets need us. People need us, and aspiring veterinarians need us to drive a change for the profession.\u201d\n\nFlossie runs alongside Price during a visit to the Culver City dog park on Oct. 12. Amanda Lopez for TIME\n\nA new vet school that opened at the University of Arizona in August is among those that have stopped requiring applicants to have a minimum number of hours of clinical experience. Instead, applicants can explain how they\u2019ve found success in the face of hardship or how they\u2019ve adapted to change. Of the 110 students in its inaugural class, 33% were minorities, officials say.\n\n\u201cWe should not exclude someone from our profession just because they may come from an underserved community,\u201d says Julie Funk, the vet school\u2019s dean. \u201cThe very future of the veterinary profession is dependent on our ability to serve society as a whole.\u201d Several other vet schools have recently hired managers to oversee diversity efforts or have donated to scholarships that help underrepresented minority students. The Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges says it reached a milestone in 2020 of having about 20% of its total enrollment consisting of racial and ethnic underrepresented minorities.\n\nThere\u2019s no better moment for industry leaders to commit, advocates say. The demographics of the U.S. are changing, and so are those of pet owners. A record high number of Americans own pets, according to the American Pet Products Association trade group, with estimates ranging from 56.8% to more than 65% of U.S. households. Minority groups are fueling that growth, a 2019 study found. Between 2008 and 2018, the number of Hispanic pet owners increased 44%, the number of Black pet owners grew 24% but the white pet owner population went up only 2%, according to the study. At this rate, Daniel says, the industry could suffer financially if it doesn\u2019t keep up with the needs of the changing pet-owning population.\n\n\u201cWe have to do more,\u201d Daniel says, \u201cand this is the time.\u201d\n\nGet The Brief.

{"China Reports Faster Economic Recovery After Bringing COVID-19 Under Control": [["China Reports Faster Economic Recovery After Bringing COVID-19 Under Control", "(BEIJING) \u2014 China\u2019s economic growth accelerated to 4.9% over a year earlier in the latest quarter as a shaky recovery from the coronavirus pandemic gathered strength.\n\nFigures announced Monday for the three months ending in September were in line with expectations after the ruling Communist Party declared the outbreak under control in March and began reopening factories, shops and offices.\n\nFactory output rose, boosted by foreign demand for Chinese-made masks and other medical supplies. Retail sales, which had lagged behind the manufacturing rebound, finally returned to pre-virus levels.\n\nThe economy \u201ccontinued the steady recovery,\u201d the National Bureau of Statistics said in a report. However, it warned, \u201cthe international environment is still complicated and severe.\u201d It said China still faces \u201cgreat pressure\u201d to prevent a resurgence of the virus.\n\nChina, where the pandemic began in December, became the first major economy to return to growth with a 3.2% expansion in the quarter ending in June. Output contracted 6.8% in the first quarter after Beijing shut down the world\u2019s second-largest economy.\n\nAuthorities have lifted curbs on travel and business but visitors to government and other public buildings still are checked for the virus\u2019s telltale fever. Travelers arriving from abroad must be quarantined for two weeks.\n\nLast week, more than 10 million people were tested for the virus in the eastern port of Qingdao after 12 cases were found there. That broke a streak of almost two months with no virus transmissions reported within China.\n\nIndustrial production rose 5.8% over the same quarter last year, the National Bureau of Statistics reported, a marked improvement over the first half\u2019s 1.3% contraction.\n\nChinese exporters have benefited from the economy\u2019s relatively early reopening and global demand for masks and other medical supplies. They are taking market share from foreign competitors that still are hampered by anti-virus controls.\n\nRetail sales returned to positive territory in the latest quarter, rising 0.9% over a year earlier.\n\nThat was up from a 7.2% contraction in the first two quarters as consumers, already anxious about a slowing economy and a tariff war with Washington, put off buying. In a sign demand is accelerating, sales in September rose 3.3%.\n\nChina has reported 4,634 coronavirus deaths and 85,685 confirmed cases, as well as three suspected cases.\n\nEconomists say China is likely to recover faster than some other major economies due to the ruling party\u2019s decision to impose the most intensive anti-disease measures in history. Those temporarily cut off most access to cities with a total of 60 million people.\n\nPrivate sector analysts say as much as 30% of the urban workforce, or as many as 130 million people, may have lost their jobs at least temporarily. They say as many as 25 million jobs might be lost for good this year.\n\nThe ruling party promised in May to spend $280 billion on meeting goals including creating 9 million new jobs. But it has avoided joining the United States and Japan in rolling out stimulus packages of $1 trillion or more due to concern about adding to already high Chinese debt.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

{"Mars CEO Grant Reid Wants Candy to Lift One Million People Out of Poverty. Here\u2019s His Plan to Make It Happen": [["Mars CEO Grant Reid Wants Candy to Lift One Million People Out of Poverty. Here\u2019s His Plan to Make It Happen", "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, Oct. 18; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)\n\nMany candy lovers (at least this one) aren\u2019t aware that chomping into a Milky Way bar may make one complicit in child-labor law violations and deforestation. The commodities that go into candy and gum\u2014cocoa, mint and palm oil\u2014are produced by some of the most impoverished people in the world, living in some of the world\u2019s most environmentally vulnerable areas. Grant Reid, the CEO of Mars\u2014the 109-year-old, $40 billion privately held pet-care, candy and food behemoth\u2014has embarked on a multiyear effort to make the global food-supply chain more equitable and sustainable. He\u2019s working with NGOs, governments and suppliers around the world to achieve that goal. As a private company with the third, fourth and fifth generations of the founders involved (they are referred to as G3, G4 and G5), Mars is better able to tackle complex, long-term problems than public corporations, which are subject to the brutal fun-house ritual known as quarterly earnings calls with Wall Street analysts.\n\nReid recently joined TIME for a video conversation about Mars\u2019 diverse portfolio. The company\u2019s pet-food and pet-care business, featuring brands like Pedigree (dog food) and Whiskas (cat food), is performing strongly in the pandemic as furry companions have become as popular as toilet paper; the pet business is now bigger than candy or food sales. He also discussed Mars\u2019 ambitions, including the company\u2019s belief that \u201ceveryone working within our extended supply chains should earn sufficient income to maintain a decent standard of living,\u201d and its plan to reduce its carbon footprint by 67% by 2050.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\n(This interview with Mars CEO Grant Reid has been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nI hate to start out with a Grinch-like question, but how much will the curtailing of Halloween this year impact Mars?\n\nDigital is changing everything, so we\u2019ve taken the opportunity to put together a really cool app called Treat Town, which allows you to customize your door, just like a real door at home. People can collect points and then take it to the store and get real candy. We\u2019re using the adversity we face with COVID and trying to bring that feeling of joy to kids and parents.\n\nStill, do you anticipate a revenue hit without kids trick-or-treating door to door?\n\nNobody really knows. Our role is just to make sure that we have the right products available for the consumers and try and make it as fun and as accessible as possible. We\u2019ll find out in the next few weeks.\n\nWith people hunkered down at home and not going to the office and on dates, I understand that the gum business has taken a hit. (Mars owns Wrigley.)\n\nWe\u2019re pretty confident it will bounce back, but that\u2019s definitely a challenge. If people aren\u2019t popping it for fresh breath because they\u2019re not socializing as much, then there\u2019s bound to be a hit.\n\nBy what order of magnitude is the gum category down?\n\nOff the top of my head, I\u2019d say probably 15, 20%.\n\nMars has a customized M&M business, including making specially emblazoned ones for the White House: Has M&M consumption in this Administration gone up in this White House and on Air Force One?\n\nI have no idea. Hopefully he\u2019s using it as a treat like it should be and others are using it as a treat.\n\nRunning a private company, do you wake up every morning and dance a little jig that you don\u2019t have to deal with Wall Street analysts?\n\nMaybe not every morning, but probably every second morning. Joking aside, I\u2019ve been at Mars for 31 years, and I\u2019m here not only because of the job. I\u2019m here because I work for real people who really care about making a difference in society. The second thing, because it\u2019s a private business, we put 90%-plus of the money back into our brands, our businesses.\n\nWe have a philosophy, which is \u2018Profit without purpose isn\u2019t meaningful, and purpose without profit isn\u2019t possible.\u2019 - Grant Reid, CEO of Mars\n\nCommodities are hugely important to Mars. Can you talk about your experience in the field and the company\u2019s evolving approach?\n\nSo I bought commodities myself. I\u2019ve walked cocoa fields in Ghana and C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire and Brazil, and I\u2019ve seen peanuts in Nicaragua, farms in New Zealand for dairy products. When I bought commodities, we bought on price, quality and delivery. Now quality and price and delivery are still as important today as they were before, but the definition of quality isn\u2019t just good taste now. The definition of quality is what\u2019s it doing to the environment, what\u2019s it doing to the people in the supply chain?\n\nYou just reached a significant milestone in your big palm-oil initiative. What drove your efforts there?\n\nProbably not a lot of people know that palm oil goes in almost all products\u2014it\u2019s incredible\u2014from shampoos to chocolate and everything in between. A lot of palm oil comes from areas that have been taking down tropical rain forests. When they burn that, it releases tremendous amounts of greenhouse gas. We\u2019ve tried for some years to work with the commodity suppliers, and we found that we really weren\u2019t making much progress. So we took a leadership position. We said, \u201cWe need a new theory of change.\u201d And the new theory of change is we\u2019re not just going to go out to 1,500 palm-oil suppliers, we\u2019re going to work with a much smaller group who really care and really want to make a difference. So we\u2019ve cut down from 1,500 suppliers where we didn\u2019t know where the palm oil was really coming from, down to about 100 suppliers, and by 2022 we\u2019ll probably be down to more like 50. We know exactly where it\u2019s coming from, that it\u2019s not causing deforestation.\n\n(READ MORE: BTS\u2019s Parent Company Is Going Public. Here\u2019s How The Music Industry Could Replicate Its Massive Success)\n\nAnd you are making similar progress with cocoa and across your supply chain?\n\nWe want at least a million people to benefit from working with Mars through our extended supply chain. And that\u2019s where we start. I mean, cocoa is certainly a big part of that, but it includes all of our raw materials; we buy sugar, we buy mint, we buy fish from Thailand. We\u2019ve done a lot of work on mint. We\u2019ve worked with companies like Danone and the Livelihood Funds to really change the way that vanilla is grown. We\u2019re very active in a number of areas to try and make sure that a million people really benefit from working with us. We have a philosophy, which is \u201cProfit without purpose isn\u2019t meaningful, and purpose without profit isn\u2019t possible.\u201d\n\nAnd when you look at your carbon footprint, you are looking across your entire supply chain, not just your own company?\n\nOur ambition is to cut our greenhouse-gas emissions by 67% by 2050. We\u2019re on a great path to that because as the company grows, our greenhouse-gas emissions are going down. And we\u2019ve done that in a number of ways. We\u2019ve used, coming back to the commercial-procurement side, novel ways of approaching it. So we\u2019ve invested in wind farms, for example, in the U.S., the north of Scotland, Mexico and China; 53% of our total electricity use around the world comes from renewable sources, and our mission is to get that to 100. What we do is we work with partners to invest in wind farms, and we give them a long-term contract, and that allows us to get renewable energy. We [also] looked at our operation; how much greenhouse-gas emissions are coming from our factory, from our associates driving cars? But what you find is that\u2019s probably 10 to 20% of your total carbon footprint; 80% is in your extended supply chain. Unless you solve your widest supply chain, nothing\u2019s going to happen.\n\nWe want at least a million people to benefit from working with Mars through our extended supply chain. - Grant Reid, CEO of Mars\n\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot about all the good things you\u2019re doing. What is your secret shame? Where could you be doing better?\n\nI think we\u2019re falling short pretty much everywhere. I mean, that\u2019s just business, right? I\u2019d love to be growing more, and I\u2019d love to make a bigger difference in the environment. I\u2019d love to do even more, faster. We call it at Mars \u201ca healthy dissatisfaction.\u201d\n\nBroadly, how is capitalism working?\n\nAnytime there\u2019s anybody who\u2019s in forced slavery in a supply chain or you\u2019re burning down forests and causing other issues or viruses escaping or greenhouse gases, you can\u2019t be comfortable that capitalism is working perfectly. You\u2019ve got to keep working on it.\n\nWhere did you grow up?\n\nIn a small mining village in Scotland. The work ethic was pretty strong. I\u2019ve worked in glass-bottle-making factories, I\u2019ve dug trenches, I\u2019ve painted bridges\u2014all those things as I was working my way through college. I was the first in my family to go to university.\n\nWhat does America mean to you?\n\nIt means opportunity and freedom.\n\nDo you think that is changing?\n\nNo. I came to America 30 years ago in a fairly midlevel position. I\u2019m an American citizen now. My wife\u2019s an American citizen. Both my kids are American. I\u2019ve got a life I could only have dreamt about back in my poor mining village in Scotland.\n\nWhat is the most beautiful place you\u2019ve ever seen on your business travels?\n\nNew Zealand, round about the Queenstown area.\n\nWhat was the saddest thing you ever saw on your business travels?\n\nThe poverty in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire.\n\nWhat is your preferred method for having meetings?\n\nI have a signature process called walk-and-talk. It changes the dynamic; it makes it more personal. You\u2019ve got a closer engagement. I think people feel like they\u2019ve got more focus from me. I\u2019ve done that for many years.\n\nWhat type of behavior do you not tolerate in the workplace?\n\nThe obvious ones, obviously, you know: sexual harassment, bullying. That\u2019s all unacceptable. But the micro things, like coming to meetings late. That doesn\u2019t work for me. So I just close the door and we start the meeting. If I\u2019m the only one there, I\u2019ll start. It\u2019s not O.K. for me to be late, either.\n\nREID\u2019S FAVORITES\n\nLEADERSHIP BOOK: Tactical Genius in Battle. I found it in an old book sale\u2014it had to be at least 20 years ago. It takes you through all the great generals and talks about how they won battles and how they think. I call it vision/commitment, speed/agility, communication and capability.\n\nAUTHORS: Churchill for nonfiction and Dickens for fiction.\n\nAPP: Audible. If I\u2019m driving long distances or I\u2019m out for a run, I can listen to books and learn.\n\nEXERCISE: I\u2019ve always liked exercise, whether it\u2019s walking the dog, riding a bike. So I walk, I run, I do quite a bit of weight training, and I\u2019ve done a lot of martial arts over the years, so boxing, judo, kickboxing, jujitsu. A little bit less of that since I broke my collarbone in judo, but I still hit the heavy bags.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nCorrection, October 18\n\nThe original version of this story misstated the name of Mars\u2019 digital trick-or-treating experience.

{"Workers Who Were Laid Off Say They\u2019re Being Passed Over\u2014For Their Own Jobs": [["Workers Who Were Laid Off Say They\u2019re Being Passed Over\u2014For Their Own Jobs", "Like millions of Americans who lost their jobs during the pandemic, Jorge Padilla had hoped to work for many more years before the economic meltdown interrupted his plans. But in March, Padilla was laid off from his job as a banquet server in the Las Vegas area when tourism all but disappeared, and even though his old company has ramped up hiring again, it hasn\u2019t contacted him.\n\nPadilla says that\u2019s because Station Casinos, which owns the Green Valley Ranch Resort Spa and Casino where he worked for nine years, is making anyone who wants a job reapply and is hiring mostly lower-paid workers rather than longtime employees like him. \u201cWe worked hard for this company, and we were loyal for many years,\u201d says Padilla, 57, who used to pull in about $13.40 an hour plus tips, which amounted to up to $40 an hour in the busy season. \u201cNow it\u2019s time for them to give us a chance to come back.\u201d\n\nLabor unions agree, and as the bleak U.S. job situation shows no sign of a major revival, they are pushing for legislation to ensure that people who lost jobs in the pandemic get first dibs when those positions reopen. Such ordinances, known as Right to Recall or Right of Recall bills, have passed in both the city and county of Los Angeles, San Diego, Oakland, and Long Beach. Drafts of similar bills are circulating in Honolulu, Providence, R.I., and in Tacoma, Wash. A Baltimore city council committee approved one such bill in September, but it has not yet been signed by the mayor.\n\nThe hospitality industry says such bills hamper efforts by companies struggling to survive and slow economic recovery. \u201cThis type of mandate creates a new operational burden as employers are trying to get back to business and reopen as best they can,\u201d says Troy Flanagan, the vice president of government affairs and industry relations at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Among other things, Flanagan says some of the mandates give workers a few days to decide whether they want to return to work, which delays quick hiring.\n\nWithout legal guarantees, though, older workers like Padilla say they\u2019ll struggle to find jobs in a crowded labor market. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for young people, they never think, \u2018this old man, he dedicated his life to this company,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cBut I\u2019m ready to go back to work.\u201d\n\nStation Casinos said in a statement provided to TIME that 1,300 workers who were laid off have returned to work, making the same or more money than they did before the layoffs, \u201cunless they took a job in a different classification.\u201d It did not respond to questions about whether it was also hiring new workers for lower pay in place of longer-term workers. The company\u2019s website has dozens of jobs posted, including for a part-time food server and a bus person who could earn, according to the website, \u201cup to $12.65 an hour.\u201d\n\nThe Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents some Station Casinos employees, says that 58% of Station Casinos workers in its bargaining unit have lost their jobs and that those who want to return to work are being asked to reapply as new employees and are receiving $3-$4 less per hour than they did previously. It showed TIME a worker\u2019s earnings statement that included a line in all caps saying: \u201cYour hourly rate has been changed from 16.3000 to 13.1000,\u201d indicating a pay cut.\n\nAs jobs return, no guarantees\n\nThe U.S. economy shed 22.3 million jobs between March and April alone, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and these losses were concentrated among lower-wage jobs in fields like hospitality. About 14 million jobs have come back since then, but there\u2019s no guarantee they went to the same people who lost them. About 10% of firms who were adding employment between February and June were growing from external hires, rather than from recalls, even if they had shed their initial workforce, according to a July paper by economists from the Federal Reserve and the University of Chicago.\n\nThis is not necessarily surprising; employers often use recessions to pay new workers less because they have such a large pool of potential applicants to choose from, says Ruth Milkman, the Labor Studies Chair at the City University of New York\u2019s School of Labor and Urban Studies.\n\nThe pandemic has particularly decimated the minority workforce; Latinos lost 6 million jobs between February and April and have only gained about half of them back; Black workers lost 3.5 million jobs between February and April and have gained 1.3 million back, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Without a resurgence in the hospitality and entertainment jobs that were dominated by Latino and Black workers\u2014which is unlikely as long as the pandemic continues\u2014 these individuals could experience long-term financial hardship. Because many were in low-wage jobs in the first place, they don\u2019t have the savings that higher-wage workers might have collected.\n\n\"We worked hard for this company, and we were loyal for many years.\"\n\nUnions say that without legislation to prevent them from doing so, hotels and hospitality companies will lay off older workers who may make more money and workers who have advocated for unions.\n\n\u201cEmployers have taken this moment to terminate wholesale entire workforces up and down our jurisdiction,\u201d says Kurt Petersen, the co-president of Unite Here Local 11, which represents more than 30,000 hospitality workers in Southern California and Arizona. \u201cThey are hiring back selectively who they want to bring back, and I think they are going to want to whiten the workforce, make it younger, and purge \u2018troublemakers,\u2019 and higher cost employees.\u201d\n\nThe Las Vegas Strip on Aug. 23, 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has devastated tourism in the city, leaving laid-off workers like Jorge Padilla struggling to get by and hoping their former employers give them their jobs back. Bill Clark\u2014CQ/Roll Call, Inc/Getty Images\n\nThe hospitality industry says it wants to bring back trained employees but that the need for them is not yet there.\n\nSome employees who had seniority might not be trained in the work that hotels need them to do when they\u2019re recalled, says Amy Rohrer, president of the Maryland Hotel Lodging Association, which opposes the Baltimore ordinance. \u201cWe need flexibility to bring back the employees who will ensure smooth operations for the hotel and make our guests feel comfortable when they\u2019re traveling,\u201d she says. \u201cWho is to say that an employee with four years of experience, who is very eager to return back to work, is not the right employee over a five-year employee who may not be as eager to return to work?\u201d\n\nA California veto, but success in San Francisco\n\nThe hospitality industry scored a victory in California in September when Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a statewide right to recall bill, saying it placed \u201ctoo onerous a burden on employers navigating these tough challenges.\u201d\n\nBut efforts are succeeding on a local level. The San Francisco Board of Supervisors in June passed an emergency ordinance requiring businesses to offer jobs to former employees ahead of new applicants, in order of seniority. Emily Haddad, a laid-off barista, was among those who spearheaded the effort.\n\nHaddad worked for the San Francisco bakery Tartine and helped organize a union drive that culminated in a vote on March 12 on whether employees wanted to be represented by the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) (Some of the ballots have been challenged, and the National Labor Relations Board is still investigating the election results.)\n\nWhen the city issued a stay at home order a few days later to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Tartine let go of workers from its four San Francisco locations. They included Haddad. A few weeks later, more people lost their jobs when Tartine\u2019s Berkeley bakery was closed after the hotel housing it terminated its contract.\n\nWhen Tartine started bringing people back as it opened for takeout, Haddad says it recalled workers who had been vocally anti-union and passed over others. \u201cI will probably never get hired back to Tartine because I was one of the main vocal union organizers,\u201d she says.\n\nFrustrated by their experience, Haddad and her co-workers, alongside the ILWU, helped persuade the Board of Supervisors to pass the right to recall ordinance, which applies to employers with 100 or more employees who laid off at least 10 people due to the pandemic. It is not retroactive.\n\nA spokeswoman for Tartine says the bakery does not hire based on an employee\u2019s view about unions. The company says it began rehiring on May 15, that \u201call employees were recalled based on classification seniority,\u201d and that it has strictly adhered to the San Francisco ordinance since its passage.\n\nWorkers in jurisdictions without right to recall legislation have no remedy. Some are finding that government programs meant to protect them, such as the Payroll Support Program under the CARES Act, which compensated the aviation industry to preserve jobs, are not effective.\n\nJilma Guevara, 58, worked as a security agent for Eulen America, a contractor at Miami International Airport, for six years, inspecting cargo put on passenger planes. She was laid off March 23 and told that she\u2019d have to reapply for her job; despite doing so twice, she says she\u2019s heard nothing. She thinks it\u2019s because she was trying to help organize a union.\n\n\"Who is to say that an employee with four years of experience, who is very eager to return back to work, is not the right employee over a five-year employee?\"\n\nGuevara says she always got positive feedback from her supervisors at work. \u201cThey had no reason to lay me off, but they found an opportunity with the pandemic,\u201d she says. Other Eulen workers say that because they were laid off and not temporarily furloughed, they must undergo new background checks and fingerprinting, at their own expense, if they want to reapply for jobs.\n\nAn Oct. 9 report from the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis found that Eulen was one of more than a dozen companies that laid off workers despite receiving money from the Payroll Support Program. Eulen received $26 million from the Program, which was part of the CARES Act and which provided aviation companies with financial assistance to cover paychecks of workers to protect their jobs. The report found that the Treasury Department allowed some companies to receive funding and still lay off workers.\n\nEulen said in a statement provided to TIME that it had to reduce its workforce early in the pandemic before it received any government support. Its goal is to hire as many former employees as possible, the company said, and it does so by contacting those in good standing and inviting them to apply.\n\nA protester at Miami International Airport on May 12, 2020, where workers were demonstrating against layoffs by the Eulen America aviation company. Joe Raedle\u2014Getty Images\n\nEconomic data suggests that when people lose their jobs, they usually cycle through short-term and lower-paid jobs, sometimes even switching fields, before finding something stable. They often end up in jobs that pay less, says Robert E. Hall, a Stanford economics professor who recently co-authored a paper looking at the impact of job losses on individuals. One study showed that men who were laid off when the unemployment rate was above 8% lost out on about 2.8 years of earnings. By contrast, many furloughed workers, who eventually get called back to their jobs, preserve their pay rate.\n\nThe disruption that comes from a layoff is one reason that some European governments began paying companies to keep workers on payrolls during the pandemic. The Paycheck Protection Program in the U.S. sought to do a similar thing, but some employers that received government money did not keep people on payrolls.\n\nAn offer she couldn\u2019t accept\n\nSome laid-off workers say they\u2019re already getting offered lower-paid jobs\u2014sometimes at the same company where they\u2019d worked before. That\u2019s what Caitlin Hickey says happened to her. Hickey, 31, was a regional supervisor for recreational programs and events at a rock climbing gym in San Diego, and was making around $26.50 an hour.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit and business tanked, HIckey says the gym wanted her to run an indoor summer camp. She says she refused because of health concerns and was laid off but told she\u2019d be in good standing if she wanted to reapply with the company when it started hiring again. A week later, she says the gym emailed her and other laid-off workers with an offer for a front desk job in Reno, Nev., 560 miles away, paying $13.50 an hour.\n\n\u201cIt took me too long to get to $26 an hour\u2014six years\u2014that I couldn\u2019t start over,\u201d says Hickey, who turned down the offer. She\u2019s now considering going back to school.\n\nThe company Hickey worked for, Mesa Rim Climbing Centers, says it laid off 125 employees and furloughed 65 at the beginning of the pandemic and has since recalled 61 people at the same position and wages, and one person for a different job. When it opened a new facility during the pandemic, it did email laid-off workers to let them know about open front desk positions, the company said. Those jobs may have been lower-paid than their previous jobs, but higher than minimum wage, it said.\n\nBeing asked to start over at a lower wage, without the benefits of vacation days or health insurance or other things they\u2019d taken years to earn, is exactly what workers like Jorge Padilla are afraid of. He and his wife both worked for Station Casinos, and they\u2019re now living off savings and unemployment. His health insurance, a benefit from his former job, expired in September, and he says he\u2019ll run out of money in a few months.\n\nPadilla liked his job, even though during the busy season he\u2019d sometimes work until 10 p.m. and have to be back at work the next morning at 3 a.m. But he\u2019d perfected the challenges of carrying a tray with 10 plates on it and of creating relationships with guests.\n\nHe\u2019s ready to be doing that job again, and it breaks his heart that a stranger may be taking his place.\n\nThe Coronavirus Brief.

{"BTS\u2019s Parent Company Is Going Public. Here\u2019s How the Music Industry Could Replicate Its Massive Success": [["BTS\u2019s Parent Company Is Going Public. Here\u2019s How the Music Industry Could Replicate Its Massive Success", "Over the weekend, BTS held a concert for nearly one million fans. The catch: it was virtual, streamed over their proprietary platform. In a music industry beset with the challenges of pandemic shutdowns, the globally-famous pop group has carved a path to ongoing connection, thanks to the foresight of their management agency, Big Hit Entertainment, and its founder and co-CEO Bang Si-hyuk (nicknamed Bang PD by fans). Big Hit\u2019s IPO, with shares releasing to the public on Oct. 15, suggests that the scrappy South Korean unicorn has ambitions\u2014and strategies\u2014intended to match and overcome the challenges of their beleaguered business.\n\nBang\u2019s music empire is built on the strength of the seven young artists of BTS who debuted in 2013, competing with South Korea\u2019s older and larger \u201cBig 3\u201d K-pop entertainment agencies\u2014SM Entertainment, YG Entertainment and JYP Entertainment\u2014and excelling beyond them, placing his group at the top of global charts. Now, with the Big Hit IPO releasing shares on the Kospi stock index for retail investors, Big Hit is taking their successes even further. South Korean news has reported that the entertainment agency will become the region\u2019s largest, entering into global competition. The IPO saw shares priced at about $118, with a valuation of just over $4 billion; when shares were listed, that price and valuation doubled to over $8 billion. (The world\u2019s largest music label, Universal Music Group, is estimated to IPO at a valuation north of $30 billion in the next few years.) Estimates suggest the K-pop industry produced sales revenues of about $5 billion annually; Big Hit alone reported over $500 million in revenue for 2019.\n\nThe company\u2019s choice to go public, and its road to getting there, holds a set of lessons about the future of global music and performance, and how some are attempting to innovate in an industry that has been facing an existential crisis due to the advent of streaming and piracy and the global coronavirus restrictions on live performance. \u201cEverybody\u2019s known for years that BTS and smart M&A [mergers and acquisitions] have propelled Big Hit to the front of the pack, but finally seeing that value gap quantified is sure to raise a lot of eyebrows,\u201d says Jakob Dorof, a Seoul-based K-pop analyst and Asian music industry consultant. \u201cIn one fell swoop, this IPO is going to show the world the value not only of the company that made BTS, but also of K-pop itself.\u201d\n\nThe K-pop model\n\nCurrently, Big Hit represents three of its own acts, owns label Source Music and game developer Superb Corp, and is the largest shareholder in fellow South Korean agency Pledis Entertainment, although BTS accounts for the lion\u2019s share of its business. Like other K-pop agencies, Big Hit manages its artists and their careers at every level: it selects them and trains them at a young age, helps them develop their artistic direction and music, sets up their touring plans, supports their virtual presences on proprietary platforms and manages their brand partnerships, endorsements and sponsorship deals, making them a full-service, one-stop shop for every aspect of crafting and monetizing a celebrity presence. It\u2019s distinct from the U.S. recording company model, where A&Rs simply scout and sign new talent for an agreed-upon number of records. Some contracts are more involved than others, but Korean entertainment companies like Big Hit are generally known to be longer-term and more all-encompassing, while record labels often leave artists to select independent management, publicity and publishing teams.\n\nThe completism of the K-pop model has led agencies to rake in serious money over the past decade; Big Hit\u2019s 2019 profit exceeded $80 million. Those returns can be at least partially attributed to K-pop\u2019s growing global popularity. On Spotify, for instance, K-pop listening has climbed 2,500% over the past six years, and in 2019 the South Korean music industry had an export value of about $560 million. That popularity peaked with BTS this year, despite market downturns and live performance losses due to COVID-19. BTS\u2019s dominance on Spotify also serves as a good case study: it was the first group from Asia to surpass 5 billion streams, hitting 12 billion in October 2020, and their song \u201cDynamite\u201d broke record streams within the first 24 hours of its global release, making them the first Korean artists to debut atop the global chart. They have 32 million monthly listeners. (The Weeknd and Drake, the platform\u2019s most popular artists, have about double that.)\n\nWhether out of desire or necessity, K-pop artists are also deeply loyal to their management companies. With all the early investment, it\u2019s rare for a group to break away from their starting team. \u201cUsually the opportunity cost of leaving is just too much,\u201d Dorof says. \u201cFor K-pop artists, leaving a company isn\u2019t like trying to find new management\u2014it\u2019s like trying to find new parents.\u201d While Western artists often chafe at contracts, the K-pop world has doubled down on the arrangement. Some have criticized the relationship, alleging abuse and secrecy, but that doesn\u2019t seem to have affected the massive success of the model.\n\nThe Big Hit difference\n\nA K-pop company going public isn\u2019t unique to Big Hit, as Paul Han, co-founder of K-pop news site Allkpop.com, explains to TIME. \u201cWhat is different is [the Big 3 K-pop companies] launched with relatively small market caps when they were small companies with a lot of room for growth. Big Hit is going public when they\u2019re at the top of K-pop, and their 10-figure market cap is larger than the Big 3 combined,\u201d Han says. \u201cI think it suggests a lot more capital investment will be pouring into K-pop so it can grow even further in the global market.\u201d Dorof concurs: Big Hit will open \u201cat roughly three or four times the current value of any of the storied \u2018big three\u2019 companies in the Korean market, so it\u2019s going to be a vertiginous shift in scale for the industry.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, the biggest two U.S. record labels\u2014Universal and Sony\u2014are owned by larger management groups that publicly trade on different exchanges (Vivendi in France, Sony in Japan). Their music portfolios are just a slice of the businesses. The third largest U.S. label, Warner Music Group, just IPOed this summer at a valuation of about $15 billion. Universal is expected to IPO at about double that, thanks to its powerful publishing arm and a deal with China\u2019s Tencent. The scale of these legacy operations is considerable. They also each have made inroads as distribution platforms for K-pop groups, complicating the competition.\n\nBut Big Hit, like its Korean competitors, is much more than just a music label, and has room to grow in new directions. From the start, they have invested in developing proprietary technology platforms that connect their acts with the fans, owning the engagement experience from top to bottom. In the U.S., an artist\u2019s presence is often more atomized: they might manage their own social media while also lending their name to separate sponsorship deals and appearing on other media channels, from TV to streaming platforms, of which they have no ownership themselves. Fans may need to make a Ticketmaster account to buy show tickets, follow their website for new music updates and discover via an ad that they\u2019re promoting a special meal at McDonald\u2019s, with little centralization.\n\nConnecting with a Big Hit act, on the other hand, is a fairly unified experience. To buy tickets to a show or branded merchandise, a fan needs to download their app; to watch exclusive digital content, or to stream a virtual concert, that also all happens on their owned networks. Han sees this breadth of Big Hit\u2019s ownership as a critical piece of what sets their business strategy apart. \u201cThey\u2019re letting investors know that they\u2019re not a one-trick pony and they have many avenues for growth,\u201d he says. That includes diversifying their portfolio with the extra acts, as well as investing in their tech platforms and virtual performance opportunities. \u201cK-pop companies build up and stake rights in their artists\u2019 IP portfolios: their stage names, their songs, their choreo and videos, their live show, their lore\u2014all these things that Big Hit is leveraging so successfully in video games, cartoons, comic books, avatars, and on and on,\u201d says Dorof. Like Disney franchises, the IP is comprehensive. And like those franchises, the fandoms are intense: the company\u2019s most recent corporate briefing has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube.\n\nThat fandom is aggressively managed. \u201cThe artist-fan relationship is so important and investing efforts in developing that is what builds loyalty and a strong fandom,\u201d says Kossy Ng, Head of Artists & Label Partnerships Asia at Spotify, highlighting the power of BTS\u2019s \u201cARMY\u201d fanbase. She is particularly intrigued by the BTS audience\u2019s expansion beyond that region, including in Latin America and the U.S., the most popular market for the group on that platform. And when Spotify launched in Russia, for instance, BTS immediately became one of the country\u2019s top-streamed artists, according to the platform. \u201cThey\u2019re truly a global phenomenon at this stage,\u201d Ng says.\n\nBeyond Korea\n\nK-pop has always stood out in the global music landscape, not so much because of its sound\u2014hip-hop, rock, punk and pop are all represented in the Korean music scene\u2014but because of the \u201cidol\u201d-making process. But there\u2019s still plenty non-idol-making companies could learn from Big Hit\u2019s strategy, starting with the way they develop stars. \u201cK-pop companies have such a powerful model precisely because they find talent that\u2019s not yet ready for the market and take ownership of getting them there,\u201d Dorof says. \u201cThese days Western labels busy themselves by scrambling to outbid each other for the next kid with the latest TikTok hit\u2014who probably doesn\u2019t know why their song was a hit, how to make another, or what to do with themselves onstage\u2014then somehow trick that kid into signing away their masters.\u201d\n\nBig Hit Entertainment\n\nBig Hit\u2019s approach to owning engagement and revenue streams holistically also matters. Han says that, especially with COVID-19 shutting down many of the traditional performance paths to revenue, developing alternative ways to connect with fans like devoted social media platforms can reap big rewards. \u201cIt should teach many companies that being diverse will help when one sector of your business can suffer greatly,\u201d Han says of the Big Hit example. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is that Big Hit seems to be making moves to create technologies and compete with the internet search and application giants like Naver and Kakao, while the other entertainment labels mainly focus only on entertainment. They are using the huge reach of their artists to help promote the use of their own technology applications. They\u2019re diversifying from entertainment into internet and technology.\u201d\n\nOn October 10 and 11, 2020, Big Hit showed just how that works. BTS\u2019s virtual two-day concert required sign-in via their WeVerse platform, with tickets starting at about $44; nearly one million people watched globally. The next day, Big Hit announced that a new \u201crookie\u201d group developed as a joint project, called Enhypen, was opening up an online membership platform for special access in advance of the group\u2019s debut. Enhypen hasn\u2019t released any music, but they already have 3 million followers on WeVerse and a million on Instagram.\n\nGet The Brief.

{"Facebook Has Finally Banned Holocaust Denial. Critics Ask What Took Them So Long": [["Facebook Has Finally Banned Holocaust Denial. Critics Ask What Took Them So Long", "Facebook updated its rules on Monday to explicitly ban any content that \u201cdenies or distorts\u201d the Holocaust, after years of allowing people to deny that the genocide occurred.\n\nThe move reverses Facebook\u2019s previous stance, which was articulated by CEO Mark Zuckerberg in years of interviews as not wanting his company to be an arbiter of truth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jewish, and there\u2019s a set of people who deny that the Holocaust happened. I find that deeply offensive. But at the end of the day, I don\u2019t believe that our platform should take that down because I think there are things that different people get wrong,\u201d he told Vox\u2019s Recode in 2018.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s position, and Facebook\u2019s, has \u201cevolved\u201d since then, he said in a Facebook post published Monday. \u201cI\u2019ve struggled with the tension between standing for free expression and the harm caused by minimizing or denying the horror of the Holocaust. My own thinking has evolved as I\u2019ve seen data showing an increase in anti-Semitic violence, as have our wider policies on hate speech.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur decision is supported by the well-documented rise in anti-Semitism globally and the alarming level of ignorance about the Holocaust, especially among young people,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s vice president of content policy, Monika Bickert, in a statement.\n\nCivil rights groups welcomed the news, but questioned Facebook\u2019s timing. \u201cAs Facebook finally decides to take a stance against Holocaust denial and distortion, they claim it is because of their work with the Jewish community over the past year,\u201d said Jonathan Greenblatt, the CEO of the Anti Defamation League (ADL), in a statement. \u201cWe question this claim because if they had wanted to support the Jewish community, this change could have been implemented at any point in the last nine years.\u201d\n\nAlthough Facebook has over the past few years gradually imposed new guidelines on hate speech and content that the company defines as having the potential to incite violence, it has until recently largely stayed away from making decisions about individual conspiracy theories or claims to truth. (Last year, it said it would not fact check political ads placed by politicians or pressure groups on its platform, for example.) The first sign of a shift came as the coronavirus pandemic spread around the world, when Facebook announced it would limit the spread of COVID-19 misinformation on its platform. Then, in August, Facebook announced it would begin to consider conspiracy theories about Jewish people \u201ccontrolling the world\u201d as bannable hate speech. And on Oct. 7, the company announced it would ban QAnon, a sprawling, false conspiracy with anti-Semitic elements that says President Trump is bringing an elite cabal of child-molesters to justice. Less than a week later, it banned Holocaust denial too.\n\n\u201cI half-heartedly applaud the move,\u201d says Yael Eisenstat, Facebook\u2019s former head of global elections integrity for political ads, who left the company in 2018. \u201cThe fact that Zuckerberg has finally, after years of advocacy from anti-hate groups like the ADL and others, accepted that Holocaust denial is a blatant anti-Semitic tactic is, of course, a good thing. The fact that it took him this long to accept that these organizations had more experience than him and knew what they were talking about is dangerous.\u201d\n\nNotably, Facebook\u2019s statement also did not mention the role that its own platform has played in allowing hate speech, including anti-Semitism, to propagate more broadly.\n\n\u201cMore importantly, [Zuckerberg] still seems to ignore why Facebook is so ripe for spreading hate speech and disinformation to begin with,\u201d she tells TIME. \u201cIf he does not accompany this decision with what so many have been calling for, a complete retooling of how the business model works, then it will just be another whack-a-mole content moderation plan without changing any of the core mechanisms that encourage and amplify this kind of behavior.\u201d\n\nRead more: Sacha Baron Cohen: We Must Save Democracy From Conspiracies\n\nThat retooling of the platform, critics hope, would see Facebook change its criteria for deciding if a post should be seen by more people. Currently, it prioritizes \u201cengagement,\u201d or how many people interact with a post, which critics say gives the most inflammatory of statements an unfair advantage, contributing over the long term to a coarsening of public debate.\n\n\u201cFacebook could, if they wanted to, fix some of this,\u201d Eisenstat also said in a TED Talk published in August. \u201cThey could stop amplifying and recommending the conspiracy theorists, the hate groups, the purveyors of disinformation and, yes, in some cases even our president. They could stop using the same personalization techniques to deliver political rhetoric that they use to sell us sneakers. They could retrain their algorithms to focus on a metric other than engagement, and they could build in guardrails to stop certain content from going viral before being reviewed. And they could do all of this without becoming what they call the arbiters of truth.\u201d\n\nThe Leadership Brief. Conversations with the most influential leaders in business and tech.

{"Roger Ferguson, CEO of TIAA, on Why You Shouldn\u2019t Watch the Wild Stock Market All Day": [["Roger Ferguson, CEO of TIAA, on Why You Shouldn\u2019t Watch the Wild Stock Market All Day", "(Miss this week\u2019s The Leadership Brief? This interview below was delivered to the inbox of Leadership Brief subscribers on Sunday morning, Oct. 11; to receive weekly emails of conversations with the world\u2019s top CEOs and business decisionmakers, click here.)\n\nRoger Ferguson\u2019s Wall Street career has been marked by a series of crises. Ferguson is the president and CEO of TIAA, the Fortune 100 financial giant that is a major provider of retirement services for teachers and employees at more than 15,000 nonprofits and other institutions. He is currently working with his team to ensure that the COVID-19 economic downturn doesn\u2019t jeopardize TIAA\u2019s $1.1 trillion in assets under management. The company is the No. 1 manager of farmland investments worldwide and one of the largest commercial real estate investors globally. Ferguson, 69, came to TIAA as CEO in 2008, amid another financial crisis; previously, he was the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve on 9/11, personally leading the central bank\u2019s nimble response to that catastrophe.\n\nFerguson, who has bachelor\u2019s and law degrees from Harvard\u2014plus an economics Ph.D. from the school\u2014 is one of only four Black CEOs running a Fortune 500 company. He recently joined TIME from his home in Washington, D.C., for a conversation about the impact of climate change on investing, his advice to individual investors in a time of wild market swings and what specific steps corporate America should take to get serious about diversity.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\n(This interview with TIAA CEO Roger Ferguson has been condensed and edited for clarity.)\n\nWhat do you think of the frothy stock market, and should the many people who rely on TIAA for retirement advice watch the swings closely?\n\nWell, to start with your second question, certainly my advice to the vast majority of our participants is you don\u2019t need to watch the stock market closely every day. Our participants have many other things to do, as you well know. They\u2019re dedicated to education, to health care, to K-to-12 education. So focusing on their jobs is much more important than focusing on the ups and downs of the market.\n\nWhat\u2019s accounting for the market strength and volatility?\n\nVery low interest rates tend to almost always translate into rising equity markets for a variety of reasons. The other thing we\u2019ve seen in this market is it\u2019s been very driven by headline news. So concerns about COVID may drive the market down a little bit. Optimism about a potential cure may drive the markets up or a potential vaccine may drive the markets up. And the other thing that we\u2019ve seen in this market, certainly the recent rally, is it\u2019s been fairly narrow. Much is being driven by tech companies and other companies that are what I describe as sort of on trend, the kinds of companies that do well in this sort of lockdown, work-from-home environment.\n\nAny other guidance for investors?\n\nWhen markets are highly volatile, we try to discourage people from taking dramatic action, because we know that the average retail investor probably gets out at the low point and is very slow to get back in.\n\nA low-interest-rate environment has reinforced one of the important premises around retirement investing and any investing, which is that it\u2019s important to have a broadly diversified portfolio and to have a long time frame.\n\nI think the Fed\u2019s response to the current crisis has been very strong. - Roger Ferguson, CEO of TIAA\n\nYou\u2019re a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. What is your analysis of the Fed\u2019s response to the current economic crisis brought on by the pandemic?\n\nI think the Fed\u2019s response to the current crisis has been very strong. The challenge will be to figure out when and how to start to unravel some of this. But I think it\u2019s too early for them to even start to contemplate that at this stage.\n\nAnd on the fiscal side, would you give the same high marks to the Congress?\n\nYes. They got off to a relatively quick start compared to 2008, 2009, when Congress wasn\u2019t sure they wanted to take any action. The stock market went down quite dramatically a day or two, and then that finally got them to take action. The early response from the fiscal authorities in the United States showed that they\u2019ve learned lessons from the last time and were moving relatively quickly.\n\nWhat is your view about another round of stimulus?\n\nMy view, as with many other things, [is] two things. One is it sort of depends on the prognosis for the virus itself and vaccines. Those seems to be off a bit. But I also take a cue from my former colleagues in the Federal Reserve who have been encouraging more fiscal stimulus. And I would trust their astute judgment of the U.S. economy.\n\nYou played a critical role in an earlier crisis: You were vice chairman on the day the planes struck on 9/11. The chairman [Alan Greenspan] was out of the country. What emotions and memories do you have of that day?\n\nSo many things well up. Obviously, first, the phenomenal tragedy and loss of life. I think it stands still as the largest single loss of life in a day in America. Secondly, though, I must say it was another chance to show that the Federal Reserve could move nimbly and appropriately. And it fell on me to be sort of the leader of the Federal Reserve system, not just on that day but for most of the week thereafter. And the third thing that wells up is how much teamwork was called for to make all that come together. And the fourth was the value of clear communications and fortitude in the leadership ranks.\n\nWhat experience provided you with the wherewithal to step up as leader at that moment?\n\nIt was from many years having studied both the Federal Reserve and the financial systems. So a technical knowledge. And the fact that I had been fairly active across the system, had built relationships with the Federal Reserve presidents and others.\n\nWas there anything in how you grew up, in your background, other than the technical knowledge that prepared you for that moment?\n\nWell, you have to understand, I grew up\u2014obviously I\u2019m African American. I grew up in a very segregated Washington. I think at the end of the day, these stories are stories about resilience. I didn\u2019t have a hardscrabble upbringing in the sense of deep poverty. But certainly we never had a lot of money. And just the resilience to learn, to plug, to keep moving forward, to not let the negative things that happened for a Black kid growing up in the \u201960s and \u201970s throw you off your mark. I think people rise to the challenge if they\u2019ve had over time to rise to different kinds of challenges and haven\u2019t always had it handed to them on a silver platter. If there was a silver platter in my house, I didn\u2019t know where it was.\n\nThere has never been a Black Fed chair. Is that any sort of commentary about systemic or institutional racism in this country?\n\nIt\u2019s actually commentary about a number of things. One is the fact that, indeed, this country has a racist history. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a racist country. We have a history of slavery. And then a history of Jim Crow and then a history of segregation. And separate but equal. So one of the things it tells us is that the training that was called for, for some of these jobs, was not so equally thread across the country. It\u2019s also quite clear that some sectors, even to this day, have a lack of diversity. And the kinds of people who were selected for those jobs tend to come out of the financial sector. And that has been the case for a long time. It\u2019s also quite true\u2014and my friends Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen have been working on this in the AEA [American Economics Association]\u2014that the economics profession is, shall we say, not at the pinnacle of diversity either. So I think this is a reflection of a number of factors that go back to, from my standpoint, education, training, educational opportunities.\n\nHow much do you attribute the current political and racial climate to the current President?\n\nI think where we are when it comes to race relations in America is tied to this 30- to 40-year trend of rising inequality. And my philosophy or theory of this is when you have a period of rising inequality\u2014and therefore a sense that for many people the pie is sort of smaller while there are a few who are getting bigger chunks, for many it\u2019s smaller\u2014that is an environment that tends to lend itself to us-vs.-them kind of thinking. This rising racial tension, rising social tension\u2014being an economist, I tend to go back to sort of economic roots as one of the things that drives that. The other thing that we\u2019ve failed to explain is how greater equality actually creates a bit of a rising tide. There\u2019s a McKinsey study on wealth equality \u2026 if the average Black family had the wealth of the average white family, the economy overall would be 6% to 8% larger. I would look deeper than a particular individual because I think we\u2019re going to need to get to deeper solutions to deal with these fundamental societal issues that have emerged over the last several years.\n\nHow can companies do a better job on diversity and inclusion?\n\nFirst, to be clear, it takes time. Secondly, it has to start at the top of the house. Third is all of this has to do with hiring and promotion. So what does that mean? You\u2019ve got to have diverse slates of candidates. And insofar as you can do it, you have to have diverse slates of interviewers. Also, one has to look very, very closely at internal mobility. I see in many companies the ability to bring in lots of diverse talent and then sort of watch it fade away, depart, leave after three, four or five years. So it\u2019s not good enough just to have a really good hiring process. It\u2019s also a development process. And frankly, recognizing, in all honesty, that really good, diverse talent is a bit of a scarce resource. If need be, making sure you\u2019re investing and, indeed, overinvesting to bring people along.\n\nReturning to investing for a bit, I was just talking to a Wall Street friend who described the current bond environment as return-free risk. Do you agree with that analysis?\n\n[Laughs.] Certainly one who has been watching the market for a long time could not have imagined the kind of very low interest rates we have here in the U.S. Or negative rates in other countries. And so we are in highly unusual times.\n\nTIAA advocates for annuities for many of your investors. Why are they such a good investment, and why have they gotten such a bad rap?\n\nI think many people don\u2019t really understand annuities in the following sense. When you ask individuals if they want to have a guaranteed income for life or a personal pension or retirement paycheck, they almost always say yes, they do. If you said you wanted an annuity, they sometimes said no. So the first thing that we know about annuities is that it\u2019s a question of framing, explaining what it is as opposed to using jargon. Secondly, to be fair, there are some annuities that have more bells and whistles, and maybe aren\u2019t as good as the ones that we offer.\n\nWhat first drew you to economics?\n\nI fell in love with economics when I was 15 or 16. My mother was a public-school teacher in Washington, D.C., and put a huge amount of weight on education. My father was a mapmaker, a cartographer for the U.S. Army. He was a child of the Depression, and although we didn\u2019t have much money, he was very interested in banking and investments. And while many folks would sit around the table talking about a variety of different things, my father and I would spend much of my formative time talking about investments, interest rates, banks and how the financial system functioned.\n\nIf there was a silver platter in my house, I didn\u2019t know where it was. - Roger Ferguson, CEO of TIAA\n\nLet\u2019s talk about TIAA\u2019s portfolio. How does climate change influence your view of your farmland holdings?\n\nWe want to own lands that hopefully are resilient to those kinds of big moves. I was talking the other day to the folks who oversee the wine grapes that we grow. And talking about the locations that we have to be less dependent on irrigation. We also were talking about ways to use recycled water appropriately to irrigate land. If one is going to be in the business of agriculture and managing agricultural lands, or leasing to others, you have to take into consideration how do you make sure you do that in a way that\u2019s consistent with the possibility that one of your most important inputs, mainly water, might become more and more scarce.\n\nDo you own wineries?\n\nWe don\u2019t own wineries. We own vineyards that grow the grapes that go into a range of wineries. If you drink wine, you may be supporting the retirement of your favorite college professor.\n\nLast question: Is there another profession that interests you? You ever think about if you were doing it again, what you would do?\n\nThere\u2019s never going to be another profession other than economics. I joke, though, whenever I retire from doing this, the next thing I want to do is to be a mail carrier. The Postal Service as you know was created by Ben Franklin, and it is one of the great democratizing institutions ever. The thought that the average person could send a letter across this country for a predicted, specified amount\u2014the stamp\u2014was quite a revolutionary idea. In Europe, mail delivery, postal service, was something that was sort of for the elites. It\u2019s one of those sort of thankless [jobs that] without which we couldn\u2019t have the society that we have today. And people have often taken it for granted. The fact we have mailboxes on corners, and get letters delivered anyplace in the world, is frankly a miraculous concept. So if I had another job to do, that would contribute greatly to America, it would be to be a mail carrier.\n\nSubscribe to The Leadership Brief by clicking here.\n\nFERGUSON\u2019S FAVORITES\n\nBUSINESS BOOKS: My favorite business books are things written by Mike Porter.

{"Cybersecurity Pioneer John McAfee Arrested in Spain on U.S. Tax Evasion Charges": [["Cybersecurity Pioneer John McAfee Arrested in Spain on U.S. Tax Evasion Charges", "Elusive cybersecurity pioneer John McAfee was arrested in Spain for tax evasion in the U.S., the Justice Department in Washington said.\n\nMcAfee is accused of failing to file U.S. tax returns from 2014 to 2018 and hiding assets including real estate, a vehicle and a yacht in the name of others, prosecutors said. An indictment returned in June was unsealed on Tuesday after he was taken into custody. He\u2019s being held pending extradition, the Justice Department said.\n\nHe was arrested on Oct. 3 at Barcelona airport while traveling to Istanbul, according to an official at Spain\u2019s national police force, who can\u2019t be identified under internal policies.\n\nU.S. prosecutors claim McAfee earned millions of dollars through the promotion of cryptocurrencies, speaking engagements, consulting jobs and the sale of the rights to his life story for a documentary, but never filed tax returns. Instead, his income was paid into accounts held in the names of others, prosecutors claim. He faces as long as five years in prison if convicted of tax evasion and a year if found guilty of failing to file taxes.\n\nIt\u2019s the latest legal complication for the eccentric software mogul, who was a person of interest in a murder in Belize, though not charged with a crime, and last year he was detained in the Dominican Republic for entering the country with a cache of firearms and ammunition. He was also briefly a candidate for president in this year\u2019s U.S. election, ending his run from abroad in March.\n\nThe criminal charges were announced just hours after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued McAfee for promoting the sale of cryptocurrencies without disclosing that he was being paid to do so.\n\nThe commission claims McAfee recommended at least seven initial coin offerings to his Twitter followers from at least November 2017 to February 2018 without revealing that he earned more than $23 million to boost them. He\u2019s also accused of denying that he was being paid when asked by investors.\n\nThe SEC is seeking to force McAfee to disgorge all his ill-gotten gains, and to prohibit him from taking part in the issuance, purchase or sale of any digital asset securities and unspecified monetary penalties.\n\nMcAfee didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe commission also accused McAfee of claiming to be an investor or technical advisor, \u201ccreating the impression that he had vetted these companies, that they were benefiting from his technical expertise, and that he was willing to invest in the ventures.\u201d\n\nWhen a blogger exposed that he was being paid, McAfee was still holding \u201cvirtually worthless\u201d securities from the offerings he promoted and encouraged investors to buy them \u2014 without revealing that they were his own securities and he had paid a third party to recommend them, according to the complaint.\n\nMcAfee also engaged in a practice called scalping, in which he accumulated large amounts of digital securities and promoted them on Twitter without disclosing his intention to sell, the SEC said.\n\nMcAfee founded his epynonymous software firm in 1987. Intel Corp., seeking to build security features directly into its chips, bought the company for $7.7 billion in 2010, with TPG and Thoma Bravo taking stakes later. In 2016, Intel announced that it had signed a deal to transfer a 51% stake in the business to TPG for $1.1 billion. The company filed to go public last month.\n\n\u2013With assistance from Olga Kharif, Thomas Gualtieri and Laura Millan Lombrana.\n\nGet The Brief.

The deal is expected to close by the end of 2021. Separately, AMD reported better-than-expected profit and revenue for its latest quarter. Xilinx rose 11%, while AMD lost 2% in premarket trading as of 7:35 a.m. ET.\n\nMerck (MRK) \u2013 The drugmaker reported quarterly earnings of $1.74 per share, 30 cents a share above estimates. Revenue also beat forecasts and Merck raised its full-year forecast. Results received a boost from rising sales of its cancer drug Keytruda. Merck was higher by 1.5% in premarket trading as of 7:35 a.m. ET.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) \u2013 Caterpillar came in 16 cents a share above estimates, with quarterly profit of $1.34 per share. Revenue came in above estimates as well. The heavy equipment maker is still not issuing guidance amid continued global economic uncertainty. The shares fell slightly in premarket trading.\n\n3M (MMM) \u2013 3M earned $2.43 per share for its latest quarter, compared to a consensus estimate of $2.26 a share. Revenue also topped forecasts. 3M expects sales to be flat to up low single digits in October, although it did not give any other guidance. 3M shares fell slightly in premarket trading.\n\nStanley Black & Decker (SWK) \u2013 The toolmaker reported quarterly earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the consensus estimate of $2.73 a share. Revenue came in below Wall Street forecasts, however, with the company saying shipments in its tools and storage segment were shifted into the current quarter from September. The shares lost 5% in premarket trading as of 7:35 a.m. ET.\n\nHarley-Davidson (HOG) \u2013 The motorcycle maker earned 78 cents per share for the third quarter, well above the consensus estimate of 21 cents a share.

Harley shares jumped 7% in premarket trading as of 7:35 a.m. ET.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) \u2013 The drugmaker missed estimates by 17 cents, with quarterly profit of $1.54 per share, with revenue below estimates as well. Lilly was impacted by slowing sales of diabetes drugs, but CEO David Ricks also pointed out to CNBC that investments in Covid-19 treatments that were not in its prior guidance also hurt results. Separately, an independent committee said a combination of Eli Lilly's Covid-19 antibody drug and the Gilead Sciences (GILD) antiviral treatment remdesivir did not show a benefit, leading to a halt in testing. The decision does not affect the FDA's evaluation of the Lilly drug as a standalone treatment.

Tom Brenner | Reuters\n\nAmy Coney Barrett took her constitutional oath as a Supreme Court justice in a nighttime ceremony outside the White House on Monday, swinging the nation's highest court to a conservative 6-3 majority. President Donald Trump, who has now selected three of the court's nine justices, called the elevation of Barrett to fill the seat of the late liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg a \"momentous day for America.\" The oath was administered by Justice Clarence Thomas on the South Lawn. Chief Justice John Roberts will administer a second oath on Tuesday in a private ceremony, formally elevating Barrett to the court. After Barrett takes the second oath, known as the judicial oath, she can begin participating in the court's decision making. At Monday night's ceremony, Barrett pledged to follow the law. \"A judge declares independence not only from Congress and the president, but also from the private beliefs that might otherwise move her,\" she said. Earlier in the day, a divided Senate voted to confirm the 48-year-old judge to a lifetime term on the court, capping a bitter fight over the partisan makeup of the judicial body, which has taken place in the middle of an unusually explosive presidential election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell speaks before the U.S. Senate votes on the confirmation of President Donald Trump?s nominee Judge Amy Coney Barrett to be an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court as they meet in the Senate Chamber of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S, October 26, 2020. Senate TV | Reuters\n\nThe vote was 52-48 along largely partisan lines, with only Sen. Susan Collins of Maine breaking with Republicans to vote against the confirmation. Barrett's elevation came just eight days before the final votes are cast in the contest between Trump and Joe Biden. Ahead of the vote, lawmakers sparred over whether Barrett's views fell within the legal mainstream. \"She's as mainstream as it gets, from our side of the aisle,\" Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said on the Senate floor. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in his own speech that Barrett held \"far right views, well outside of the American mainstream, and those views matter.\" Barrett's confirmation, which was virtually assured given the GOP hold on the Senate, is expected to shift the ideological balance of the court to the right on issues such as gun rights, abortion, business and the environment. In the coming months, the justices will also decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, through which tens of millions of Americans have access to health insurance. The case over the law will be argued on Nov. 10, one week after the election. Raising the stakes, both Democrats and Republicans have suggested the court may be called to decide the election itself, as it did in the 2000 race between President George Bush and Democrat Al Gore. Experts have said the possibility of the election being decided in court is elevated this year because of a flood of litigation related to voting rule changes that came about as a result of the spreading Covid-19 pandemic. As the Senate voted on Barrett's confirmation, the Supreme Court released an order rejecting an effort by Democrats to extend the deadline for counting absentee ballots in the battleground state Wisconsin, dividing 5-3 along partisan lines, with the Democratic appointees in dissent. The possibility of a contested election has overshadowed Barrett's confirmation process. Trump repeatedly pressed for Barrett to be confirmed in time to vote on any such cases, prompting Democrats to demand her recusal.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump gestures as he poses with U.S. Supreme Court Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett on a White House balcony after she was sworn in to serve as an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court at the White House in Washington, U.S., October 26, 2020. Tom Brenner | Reuters\n\nDuring two days of questioning before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this month, Barrett agreed to carefully weigh whether her participation in an election case would be inappropriate, but declined to commit to abstaining. The battle over Barrett's nomination was sparked last month after the death of Ginsburg, who served on the Supreme Court for 27 years. Replacing Ginsburg with Barrett represents the most stark ideological shift on the court since the liberal Justice Thurgood Marshall was replaced by conservative Thomas in 1991. Trump and his allies in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., immediately moved to replace Ginsburg before Election Day. Biden and Democrats in Congress argued the process was a sham, and pressed for Ginsburg's replacement to be named by the winner of next week's election. Schumer and others pointed to McConnell's 2016 refusal to even hold hearings for President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland during an election year. In remarks before Barrett's confirmation vote, McConnell defended his actions, saying that Republicans had only exercised \"the power that was given to us by the American people, in a manner that is entirely within the rules of the Senate and the Constitution of the United States.\" Barrett's confirmation is the first to come so close to a presidential election.

All 19 cities for which data was reported rose monthly and annually, with all 19 seeing larger annual gains than in July.\n\n\"A trend of accelerating increases in the National Composite Index began in August 2019 but was interrupted in May and June, as Covid-related restrictions produced modestly-decelerating price gains,\" said Craig Lazzara, managing director and global head of Index Investment Strategy at S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\n\"The last time that the National Composite matched August's 5.7% growth rate was 25 months ago, in July 2018. If future reports continue in this vein, we may soon be able to conclude that the Covid-related deceleration is behind us. \"\n\nPhoenix, Seattle and San Diego reported the highest annual gains among the 19 cities (excluding Detroit) in August.

Other home price indexes, like the measure from the National Association of Realtors, show much higher price gains because they calculate the median price of all homes sold during the month.\n\nSince there is currently much more sales activity on the higher end of the market, where there is more supply available, that is skewing the median price much higher. The Realtors reported a 15% annual price gain for September.\n\nPrices are being fueled not just by strong demand but by record low mortgage rates. Rates set several new records over the summer and continued to do so in September as well. Low mortgage rates give buyers more purchasing power, allowing sellers to raise prices.\n\n\"Weekly home price data shows that sellers continue to be in the driver's seat as asking prices maintain records. This has kept the median home price stuck near summer's peak even as snow begins to fall in some markets,\" said Danielle Hale, chief economist for realtor.com. \"Looking forward, we expect continued price growth in the months ahead as demand holds steady with mortgage rates below 3%.\"\n\nThe median sale price for newly built homes rose 3.5% in September annually, according to the U.S. Census.

{"AMD to buy chip peer Xilinx for $35 billion in data center push": [["AMD to buy chip peer Xilinx for $35 billion in data center push", "Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices on Tuesday said it has agreed to buy Xilinx in a $35 billion all-stock deal that will intensify its battle with Intel in the data center chip market.\n\nThe deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, would create a combined firm with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The two U.S. firms have benefited from a more nimble approach to grab market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing.\n\nAMD has long been Intel's chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business. Since Chief Executive Lisa Su took over AMD in 2014, she has focused on challenging Intel in the fast-growing business of data centers that power internet-based applications and services and are fuelling the rise of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation telecommunications networks.\n\nXilinx has also been working to penetrate data centers with programmable processors that help speed up specialized tasks such as compressing videos or providing digital encryption. Its primary rival in the area, Altera, was scooped up by Intel for $16.7 billion in 2015 in what was then Intel's largest-ever deal.\n\n\"There are some areas where we're very strong, and we will be able to accelerate some of the adoption of the Xilinx product family,\" Su told Reuters in an interview. \"And there are some areas where (Xilinx CEO) Victor (Peng) is very strong, and we believe that we'll be able to accelerate some of the AMD products into those markets.\"\n\nThe tie-up comes at a time when Intel's manufacturing technology has fallen years behind TSMC's. AMD, which spun off its factories nearly a decade ago, has rocketed ahead of Intel with chips that perform better. The performance edge helped AMD gain its best market share since 2013 at slightly less than 20% of the CPU market, which has in turn pushed its shares up 68% between the start of the year and the close of trade on Oct. 26.\n\nXilinx also uses TSMC's factories, called \"fabs\" in the industry, to make its chips, with both U.S. companies using modular designs that let them swap out different pieces of a chip to avoid bottlenecks or delays.\n\n\"We ended up with TSMC, and have stayed with them, not due to any contractual reason \u2014 we could go to any fab at any time \u2014 but because they are best-in-class,\" Peng told Reuters in an interview. \"It's about the choices you make.\"\n\nUnder the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%. The companies said the transaction was intended to be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nAMD's Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx's Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings.\n\nAMD also reported earnings on Tuesday earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share, showed IBES data from Refinitiv.\n\nBernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said there is a danger that a major acquisition in an adjacent chip market could distract AMD's leadership while Intel fights to regain market share.\n\n\"The worry would be, AMD has this great self-grown story of their own, which is just starting to play out. Why are you doing this now? Is it just opportunistic? Does it distract from the current story?\" he said.\n\nXilinx's Peng, however, said meetings between the two companies have already revealed they have very similar methods for designing chips.\n\n\"I'll be honest, I don't think it's really as challenging as some other combinations,\" he said. \"I had one of my leadership teams who was not familiar with AMD say to me after a meeting, 'Boy, they're just like us.'\""], "CNBC", "10/27/2020, 13:15:06"]}

TOLGA AKMEN | AFP via Getty Images\n\nLONDON \u2014 Antibodies against the coronavirus fall as people recover from the disease, according to the findings of a major U.K. study, potentially dealing a blow to those pushing for so-called herd immunity. Researchers from Imperial College London screened 365,000 people in England over three rounds of testing between June 20 and September 28. Analysis of finger-prick tests carried out at home found that, rather than people building immunity over time, the number of people with antibodies that can fight Covid-19 declined roughly 26% over the study period. The REACT-2 study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that 6% of those tested had antibodies to the virus when the U.K.'s lockdown measures were relaxed over the summer. However, by the start of the second wave of cases last month, this figure had fallen to 4.4%. \"This very large study has shown that the proportion of people with detectable antibodies is falling over time,\" said Helen Ward, one of the authors of the study and professor at Imperial College London. \"We don't yet know whether this will leave these people at risk of reinfection with the virus that causes COVID-19, but it is essential that everyone continues to follow guidance to reduce the risk to themselves and others.\"\n\nWhat does it mean for herd immunity?\n\nThe findings suggest that there may be a decline in the level of population immunity in the months following the first wave of the coronavirus epidemic, potentially dashing the hopes of those calling for a controversial herd immunity response strategy. Herd immunity occurs when enough of a population is immune to a disease, making it unlikely to spread and protecting the rest of the community, according to the Mayo Clinic. It can be achieved through natural infection \u2014 when enough people are exposed to the disease and develop antibodies against it \u2014 and through vaccinations. Health experts estimate that around 70% of the population would need to be vaccinated or have natural antibodies to achieve herd immunity.\n\nA man wearing a protective face mask, shelters from the rain under an umbrella as he walks past Chancery Lane underground station in London on October 21, 2020, as the government considers further lockdown measures to combat the rise in novel coronavirus COVID-19 cases. JUSTIN TALLIS | AFP via Getty Images\n\nSome epidemiologists have suggested that aiming for herd immunity would be a better response to the pandemic than lockdown measures. Many others, however, have sharply criticized a strategy that could require vulnerable people to shield at home while the virus spreads through the young and healthy. Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, described calls to let the virus rip through the U.S. population unchecked as \"nonsense\" and \"dangerous.\" To date, more than 43.5 million people around the world have contracted the coronavirus, with 1.16 million related deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nImplications for reinfection\n\nThe results of the REACT-2 study showed a downward trend of antibodies in people of all age groups and in all areas of the U.K., but not in health workers. The decline was largest for people aged 75 and above, the study said, while the smallest fall was among those aged between 18 to 24 years old. Researchers found that the decline in prevalent antibodies may initially be rapid, before plateauing. They cautioned that data on this was only now beginning to emerge. The study only measured antibodies. The authors said it was not possible to determine whether the loss of antibody positivity would correlate with an increased risk of an individual being reinfected since it was not clear what contribution T cell immunity and memory responses played in protective immunity during re-exposure. T cells are part of the immune system that defends against specific foreign pathogens.\n\nLate-night drinkers after 10pm in Soho, London, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that from Thursday pubs and restaurants will be subject to a 10pm curfew to combat the rise in coronavirus cases in England.

Bill Clark | CQ-Roll Call, Inc. | Getty Images\n\nIn a year when Democrats have high hopes of expanding their House majority, the task starts with defending the ground they gained in flipping the chamber in 2018. A rematch in swing-state Iowa will offer clues about whether forces that drove the party's success two years ago will hold up on Nov. 3. Democratic Rep. Cindy Axne, 55, aims to win a second term in Iowa's 3rd District in the southwestern portion of the state. She faces Republican David Young, the former two-term congressman whom she narrowly beat in 2018. In the district and in many others around the country, highly educated suburban voters \u2014 and White women in particular \u2014 showed signs of moving away from President Donald Trump and the GOP and toward Democrats who pledged to forge an independent path in Washington. With Trump at the top of the ticket again, 2020 will start to test whether the midterm results point to a longer-term trend. \"Much of the story of 2018 (and 2020) is a story of suburbanites, particularly white suburban women with a college education who cite community security, health care and education as important policy concerns,\" Rachel Paine Caufield, a professor of political science at Drake University in Des Moines, wrote in an email to CNBC. Des Moines, the Iowa capital, sits in the northeast corner of the 3rd District. She added that suburban voters are generally more likely to disapprove of the president's immigration policies and handling of the coronavirus pandemic, along with Trump's overall \"tone and tenor.\" Republicans such as Young have tried to regain seats they lost in the Trump era by pledging to recapture the strong pre-pandemic economy and bolster small businesses. The geographically diverse 3rd District includes young city dwellers and rural farming communities to whom Axne and Young have tried to appeal, forcing them to walk an at times tricky political line. But for political observers looking in Iowa for signs of how the rest of the country could vote, the suburbs to the north and west of Des Moines may hold the most clues.\n\nA changing district\n\nIowa Congressman David Young votes in his home precinct on November 6, 2018 in Van Meter, Iowa. Steve Pope | Getty Images\n\nIowa's 3rd District underwent a demographic shift over the last decade similar to that of many of the U.S. House seats that flipped to Democratic control in 2018. The area's median household income topped $67,000 in 2019, a spike from about $52,000 in 2009, according to U.S. Census data. Last year, 24.6% of the district's residents older than 25 had bachelor's degrees, up from 20.6% a decade earlier. In the same time period, the share of people over 25 in the 3rd District with a master's degree climbed to 7.6% from 5.8%. Paine Caufield said that as suburbs near Des Moines \"have grown and developed, they have attracted more highly educated residents with higher median incomes.\" One example is Ankeny, a community north of the capital city that also sits close to Iowa State University in Ames. At the same time, the area has not become much more racially diverse, as some suburban districts that shifted toward Democrats in 2018 did. About 88% of the district's residents were White in 2019, down from about 90% in 2009. Polls show that Axne fares better among more highly educated voters. In a Monmouth survey released last week, she held a 52% to 43% lead over Young among registered voters. The disparity in voter preference by education was stark: She had a 20-percentage-point advantage among White voters with a college degree versus a 5-percentage-point lead among voters without one. The poll also showed a bigger lead for Axne among women, 12 percentage points, than among men, 8 percentage points. The GOP's recent struggles to win over suburban women have led Trump to make explicit pleas to the voting bloc, including a series of thinly veiled attempts to stoke White fears of people of color moving into their communities. \"Suburban women, will you please like me?\" Trump asked at a rally in Pennsylvania earlier this month.\n\nThe policy debate"], "CNBC", "10/27/2020, 13:15:06"]}

While Postmates has always had plans to branch out from its core food delivery business, the coronavirus pandemic and upcoming holidays hastened the retail rollout, said Mike Buckley, the company's new senior vice president of business. Buckley is a former Nike executive who was hired to head the effort.\n\n\"Holiday shopping is a big driver of volume for merchants and so we wanted to get this solution to them as quickly as we could and help them tap into increased demand,\" said Buckley.\n\nCustomers in Los Angeles, Postmates' largest market, can access the channel through a new tab marked \"retail\" at the top of the company's app. The initial launch includes boutique stores like Estee Lauder's Le Labo, home goods retailer Parachute Home and men's clothier Buck Mason. Postmates hopes to attract holiday shoppers who might be leery of visiting stores in-person.\n\nIn launching what the company calls a \"virtual storefront,\" Postmates is tapping into a largely unmined opportunity that has arisen during the pandemic \u2013 allowing small businesses, which have spent months either shuttered or scaled-down, the chance to sell their wares online without the burdensome cost of building their own delivery platforms.\n\nThe launch also pushes Postmates, which is in the process of being acquired by Uber, further into Amazon's territory by offering customers an appealing alternative to the online retailer's Prime shipping: Instant delivery.\n\n\"We actually can deliver in some cases faster than Amazon,\" said Buckley. \"... And the experience we've created helps create exposure to consumers. And then also creates an opportunity to deliver that product really rapidly.\"\n\nOther day-of delivery platforms are also testing out retail.

Those partnerships point to yet another business opportunity that arose for those platforms this spring \u2014 using their digital marketplaces to connect pandemic-challenged stores to customers turning to virtual shopping during the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nWhile Covid-related closures have sharpened the need for customers to turn to digital platforms during the holidays, Buckley expects that even after the pandemic ends, many customers will continue to do leisure shopping on the platform.\n\n\"I think the shift for consumers to shop more and more online and the desire for kind of instant gratification of those purchases is something that's going to increase and will stay, increase post-pandemic,\" said Buckley. \"However, I do think that there's this moment of increased demand, but also, I think it creates a little bit of a consumer pull to support local businesses.\""], "CNBC", "10/27/2020, 13:15:06"]}

Getty Images\n\nAfter years of hype with little to show for it, blockchain technology is on the cusp of a breakthrough: making money in actual business applications. At JPMorgan Chase, the firm's digital currency JPM Coin is being used commercially for the first time this week by a large technology client to send payments around the world, said Takis Georgakopoulos, the bank's global head of wholesale payments. That development, along with other behind-the-scene moves, persuaded JPMorgan to create a new business to house its blockchain and digital currency efforts called Onyx, Georgakopoulos said last week in a phone interview. The unit has more than 100 dedicated staffers, he said. \"We are launching Onyx because we believe we are shifting to a period of commercialization of those technologies, moving from research and development to something that can become a real business,\" Georgakopoulos said. Initially hyped as a technology that would upend entire industries from finance to manufacturing and agriculture, blockchain has attracted billions of dollars of investment, but little in the way of tangible results yet. Venture capital funding for blockchain start-ups dropped 35% to $2.79 billion last year, according to CB Insights. JPMorgan's move could provide a boost to the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency industries, whose proponents believe that mainstream adoption is nearing. Digital currencies popped last week after PayPal announced that users could soon buy, hold and sell crypto directly from their accounts.\n\nTakis Georgakopoulos. Source: JP Morgan\n\nJPMorgan is focused on relieving pain points in the world of wholesale payments, specifically areas where the industry could save hundreds of millions of dollars with a better solution, said Georgakopoulos. In cross-border payments, for instance, which relies on a complex global web of correspondent banks, payments sometimes get rejected for errors in account information or other problems. JPMorgan is one of the biggest players in this industry, moving more than $6 trillion a day across more than 100 countries. If banks could confirm that payments have the proper account information and regulatory format before they are sent, they could prevent expensive rejections. Essential to that effort is a network with more than 400 participating banks and corporations. The group, which had been called the Interbank Information Network since a 2017 JPMorgan pilot, is being rebranded as Liink and being launched with a pair of functions that validate payments before they are sent.\n\nBanishing the check\n\nBanks could charge a few cents to confirm data for each transaction, saving money on remediating mistakes and creating a model to earn money by participating in the network, according to Umar Farooq, the bank's newly named CEO of Onyx. Another area is in processing paper checks, which relies on armies of people to handle mail at physical locations called lockboxes. That could be radically simplified with an exchange where the digital information associated with a check gets posted, skipping the mail altogether. \"We're talking about hundreds of millions of checks being sent,\" Georgakopoulos said. \"Using a version of blockchain with the participants being the main issuers of checks and the main operators of lockboxes, it's possible we can save 75% of the total cost for the industry today, and make checks available in a matter of minutes as opposed to days.\" That project is months from its commercial launch, said Farooq.\n\nUmar Farooq, CEO of Onyx.

But Jones now might have to snag a second bolt of lightning if the former federal prosecutor has a hope of retaining the seat that he has held for less than three years out of one of the nation's reddest red states.

The GOP, which holds a 53-47 edge in the chamber, is defending 23 seats, with a number of them considered at risk.

He has refused to debate Jones, just as he would not debate his GOP primary runoff opponent, Jeff Sessions. \"It's like a prize fight where the other guy is swinging wildly to get back in it, but the other guy just keeps backing away,\" said David Mowery, an Alabama political consultant and head of Mowery Consulting Group. Mowery said that Tuberville's campaign leaders \"don't want him to get out over his skis talking about stuff he doesn't need to talk about.\" Tuberville might more than make up for his lack of political experience in widespread name recognition in Alabama, having previously served as head coach of Auburn University's football team from 1999 through 2008. In the football-mad state the designations of \"Republican\" and \"Democrat\" might matter less than that of being a fan of Auburn or of the University of Alabama's Crimson Tide. Auburn beat Alabama a whopping six consecutive times during Tuberville's tenure, which was bookended by his stints as head coach of the University of Mississippi and then at Texas Tech and the University of Cincinnati. \"That's Celebrity 101, being a football coach\" in Alabama, said Angie Maxwell, director of the Diane Blair Center of Southern Politics and Society and an associate professor of political science at the University of Arkansas.\n\nSticking with Trump\n\nTuberville, 66, also has aligned himself in lockstep with Trump on policy issues \u2014 the would-be senator's campaign did not point to one difference he has with the president with any issue when asked by CNBC. \"His entire candidacy is prefaced on just supporting what the president does,\" Mowery said. And in Alabama, Trump holds a whopping average 15-percentage-point lead over former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, according to a recent Real Clear Politics review of polls. In the 2016 presidential race Trump beat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by more than 62% to 34% in the state. Given that, and given Jones' vote for Trump's conviction during a Senate trial after he was impeached by the House, it might be no surprise if Tuberville was also up by double digits over Jones. And polls have mainly suggested that is the case. An Auburn University survey released in early October showed a 12-point lead for Tuberville. Tuberville's campaign believes that the numbers reflect the idea that Alabama voters want someone who is closely aligned with Trump and who would support the president's judicial appointments, as opposed to Jones, who voted against the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. \"What I've been telling folks down here is that Jones can run the perfect race and still lose by 5 to 7 [percentage points] just because the fundamentals of our electorate are so tilted to the Republicans both by attitude and by ... straight-ticket voting,\" said Mowery. Mowery noted that Alabama ballots allow a voter to fill in a single bubble to cast votes for all of a single party's candidates, and the percentage of voters who do so in the heavily Republican state is more than 60%. \"That's the biggest problem for the Jones people,\" Mowery said, referring to the incumbent's need to get a significant number of votes from Republicans. \"He has to convince people who are Republicans to go in and vote for the Republican ticket and then go down the ballot and say, 'I'm going to vote for Doug.'\" Mowery said. \"It's just very hard to do.\" \"You have to convince somewhere between 350,000 and 500,000 people to do that.\" Before Jones, the last Democrat elected to an Alabama U.S. Senate seat was Howell Heflin, who retired in 1997 after serving three terms. Richard Shelby, the other senator from the state, was elected as a Democrat in 1986 but switched to the GOP in 1994. Mowery also said that as of a week away from Election Day, he has not seen any evidence of a major influx of outside money flowing into the state at the last minute to either save Jones or boost Tuberville. Not that Jones' polling challenges seem to be for lack of money. Jones has dramatically outraised and outspent Tuberville, according to recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics. As of eight days out from Election Day, Jones' campaign has raised $26.4 million, compared with just $7.4 million by Tuberville, a margin of more than 3-to-1, the CRP data shows. And Jones' campaign has spent $24.5 million versus the $5.9 million spent by Tuberville, a margin of more than 4-to-1.\n\nJones' hopes\n\nA shocking result\n\nAnalysts said that Jones has room to pick up some more ground on Tuberville among Alabama voters. If he does so, and catches some luck at the same time, he has a chance to pull off a second electoral shocker. The first shocker in 2017 was set in motion by Trump, after the newly elected president appointed then-Sen. Jeff Sessions as his first attorney general. Then-Alabama Gov. Robert Bentley appointed state Attorney General Luther Strange to replace Sessions until a special election was held. Jones, then a lawyer in private practice, announced his intention to contest for the seat. Jones previously had served as the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama. He was best known in that role for winning convictions of two Ku Klux Klansmen for the notorious 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church that killed four Black girls, a seminal event in the civil rights era. Despite being endorsed by Trump, who also campaigned for him, Strange finished second in a Republican primary to the controversial former Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who beat him in a runoff. Moore then snagged Trump's endorsement for the election against Jones. But the race was rocked weeks before the election by a Washington Post report about women who said Moore had pursued relationships with them when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. One of those women was 14 years old at the time. While Moore denied the allegations, his candidacy was damaged, and a number of prominent Republicans nationally abandoned their support of him. Even with that, Jones just barely won the special election, notching 49.9% of the votes cast against 48.34% for Moore. The razor-thin margin instantly made Jones a top Senate pick-off target for Republicans, who saw his win as a fluke against a flawed candidate in a state that last had a Democratic senator in 2008.\n\nTuberville moves in\n\nIn August 2018, less than a year after Jones' victory, Tuberville moved to Alabama from Florida as he weighed what became his ultimate decision to run for the Senate. \"I want to help Donald Trump and you get this mess straightened out,\" Tuberville said during an appearance in 2019, where he argued that the United States was suffering from a decline in moral values. \"And I'm going to do that,\" Tuberville said. \"But we've got to put Jesus and God before everything else. And if we don't do that we're going to be brought down to our knees again.\" Moore also entered the Republican primary. And so did Sessions, who had gone from being U.S. attorney general to being one of Trump's favorite whipping boys, even before he resigned under pressure from the president less than 24 hours after the midterm elections in 2018. Trump has blasted Sessions for years for recusing himself from the Justice Department's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Sessions' recusal ended up triggering the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigation has continued to infuriate Trump long after it ended. In the Republican primary, Tuberville edged out Sessions \u2014 with Moore running a very distant fourth place. But the former coach failed to win a majority of the votes, which forced a runoff with Sessions. Trump, who had not endorsed anyone in the primary, then came out hard for Tuberville. The president, in a tweet, called Sessions \"a disaster who has let us all down,\" adding, \"We don't want him back in Washington!\" Tuberville demolished Sessions in the July runoff, beating the former senator by more than 20 percentage points. Since then, Tuberville has continued hammering away at his conservative platform. \"I'm for guns, our Second Amendment,\" Tuberville said during a campaign stop in Red Bay, Alabama, in late September. \"I'm against abortion. I'm for religious freedom. Don't tell me where to go and when I can't go to church. We've got to get God back in our schools, folks.\" And Tuberville said, \"I'm for conservative, Christian judges. We've got one we're fixing to put in,\" a reference to Trump's recent nominee for the Supreme Court, Judge Amy Coney Barrett. Tuberville also has called for repeal of the Affordable Care Act, the health-care law popularly known as Obamacare.\n\nJones' campaign\n\nJones supports the ACA, along with other traditional Democratic policies. But he also has said he would not be a \"rubber stamp\" for Biden if they both are elected in November. There has been recent speculation that if Biden won and Jones lost, Biden would appoint Jones U.S. attorney general. Jones last week brushed aside that speculation. \"I think the people of Alabama would prefer to have a voice like mine in the Senate as well,\" Jones told reporters. \"If Joe Biden is elected president, and he is likely to be, (Biden) would rather have me in the United States Senate,\" Jones said. \"He knows my voice in the U.S. Senate is important in pulling people together. He knows those areas where we agree and disagree and that I can help pull people from the Republican side and from the left in the Democratic Party to get things done.\"\n\nRace and Alabama\n\nMaxwell, the University of Arkansas political science professor, said \"my gut\" is that Tuberville holds a lead of around 8 or 9 percentage points over Jones. \"Can [Jones] close the gap? I don't know,\" Maxwell said. But she said there was one way that he could increase his chances of doing so: \"If you have Obama-level turnout of African-Americans.\" Specifically, Maxwell said, Jones needs to get more Black men supporting him in this election than he did in 2017. She noted that Black women turned out extremely strong for Jones in the special election where he beat Moore, so much so that they provided his margin of victory. \"They were his largest group of voters, period,\" despite the fact that Blacks overall comprise just around 27% of the state's population, Maxwell said. About 98% of Black women who voted in the special election voted for Jones. Black men overwhelmingly voted for him as well, but by 6 percentage points fewer than Black women. Even with more Black voters, Jones would need help on several other fronts, Maxwell said. One area is with voters who tend to vote for whoever already is in office. \"Incumbency is usually worth a couple of points,\" she said.\n\nThe Covid-19 factor\n\nAnother area where Jones might be able to pick up some votes is among white women who would normally vote for a Republican. Maxwell said the Covid-19 pandemic \"is wearing on parents in general\" but particularly among mothers. Exasperation with the persistence of coronavirus during Trump's tenure could push some of those women to vote for Jones, she suggested. The pandemic also could help Jones in another way, by sparking an explosion in the number of voters effectively voting early by casting absentee ballots. Alabama does not technically allow early, in-person voting, as a number of other states do, particularly in light of concerns about the virus. But Alabama loosened restrictions on the requirements for getting an absentee ballot this year, allowing people that ballot if they are worried about the danger of coronavirus by going to vote in person on Election Day. Before this year, people had to swear that they would not be physically in their town during Election Day, or that they were sick or had to work during voting hours. As of last week, 145,000 absentee votes had already been either mailed in or dropped off in person in Alabama, according to state officials. That shattered, by more than 45,000 votes, the prior record for absentee ballots for an entire election cycle. Another 70,000 absentee ballots that were requested by voters have not yet been sent back, Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill told the Associated Press. Maxwell noted that \"we don't know the partisan breakdown\" of the absentee ballot voters. But, \"nationally, it's definitely higher among Democrats,\" she said. Conversely, she said, if coronavirus concerns depress turnout on Election Day among Republican voters, along with the fact that some people might think there is no need to vote for Trump because of his near certainty in winning the state, that could benefit Jones.\n\n'He's still likely to lose'"], "CNBC", "10/27/2020, 13:15:06"]}

{"How will the next opportunity unfold in speciality chemicals": [["How will the next opportunity unfold in speciality chemicals", "ET CONTRIBUTORS\n\nET CONTRIBUTORS\n\nSpeciality chemicals has been one of the few sector that have bucked the Covid-19 slowdown and most companies in this space are now poised to deliver growth in FY21. A changing geopolitical scenario will continue to drive growth over the next decade.\u201cThere are decades when nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen,\u201d Lenin once said famously. A similar story appears to be unfolding in the Indian speciality chemicals sector, which has gone through its journey of \u2018a dull decade\u2019 before the \u2018hyper-active weeks\u2019 started unfolding and changed the complexion of the industry forever.Indian speciality chemicals is actually one of the oldest sectors, which has evolved from being a supplier of natural extracts (dyes like Indigo and flavour extracts from spices) to become a diverse industry catering to global markets and commanding ~5% market share in the $600 billion global speciality chemicals market.While the sector has grown at 10% for the past decade, the industry in India was overshadowed by China, which sprinted to capture 35% of the global market in production and 25% of the global market in consumption.India is currently sixth largest manufacturer of chemicals and has consistently been the one of the leading global producers in segments like dyes and pigments, polymers and agrochemicals.While Indian companies have been leaders in several segments and have been part of the supply chain of most global customers, for investors the focus was on China and its rapid buildup in chemicals as well as speciality chemicals, which made it integral to global supply chains.Over the last five years, there has been a gradual shift in the underlying business, driven gradually by China further tightening environmental compliance norms and purchase managers feeling uncomfortable with extremely high dependence on a single source. In recent months, escalating trade tensions between the US and China became a rallying cry for users to look elsewhere, as China became increasingly belligerent with important economies such as the US, Japan, Australia and India.US sanctions on select companies and the expected impact of end-user industries convinced companies to reduce dependence on China and move towards a \u2018China+1\u2019 sourcing strategy.India with its large domestic consumption market, trained work force and a government focused on improving ease of business should be a significant beneficiary of this shift.Over the past few years, the Indian speciality chemicals sector has been on the priority list of most investors, both local and global, and it was getting reflected in the significant re-rating and improved fund-flow seen into the sectorThe size of the Indian speciality chemicals sector is expected to double from $30 billion to $60 billion over the next five years. Our analysis shows the industry will require over $10 billion to fund the incremental capex and working capital requirements through a combination of external debt and equity. The fund requirement may be even higher as companies look for backward integration and have set up units at scale significantly larger than what they have done in the past.We are witnessing significant investor interest in the sector as reflected in recent IPOs and buyout transactions. While we believe capital allocation is reflecting a shift in underlying fundamentals, the trend is expected to continue for some time. Availability of growth capital and flexibility to raise capital to consummate synergistic acquisitions will emerge as key determinants of how the leader board looks like over the next five years."], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}
{"View: To tackle global problems like Covid-19, we urgently need another renaissance": [["View: To tackle global problems like Covid-19, we urgently need another renaissance", "The Covid-19 pandemic arrived when we were on the threshold of a fourth industrial revolution, based on artificial intelligence . After successful completion of the first industrial revolution (18th-19th century, essentially a factory system) and the second one (1870-1914, essentially \u2018assembly line production\u2019), we are now passing through the third revolution based on increasingly advanced digital technology. The spread and quality of knowledge have been the foundation of all three revolutions, but even more so for the fourth revolution.The evolution of knowledge stands on the foundation of its strong backward and forward linkages. However, one of the pitfalls of the education system that has evolved during the last century is narrow specialisation, both in the natural and social sciences. It\u2019s said, albeit jokingly, that a specialist doctor of the left hand doesn\u2019t know about the right hand.Further, there is an erroneous understanding that the spread of digital applications will transport one to a \u2018knowledge society\u2019. Rather, for banishing narrow specialisation and moving to a multifaceted agenda, a renaissance like movement has to be started again. Be it Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, multi-specialisation geniuses provided the basis for the first renaissance movement.Apart from the pedestal of knowledge internalised with renaissance, equity should also be a built-in part of the societal architecture for the fourth industrial revolution. Only then will we be able to contain any societal challenge, including the present one of the Covid-19 pandemic.The state of knowledge in a society is difficult to measure, but is certainly highly related to investment in science and technology. By expanding the cognitive world of knowledge, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite (Sputnik) on October 4, 1957. The immediate US response was to free itself from its technological complacency. US Congress established NASA , and the US National Defense Education Act poured billions of dollars into science education, providing low interest loans to students pursuing higher studies in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).Thus President Donald Trump, despite his fulminations against immigration, has strengthened the policy under which highly qualified STEM professionals from across the world are allowed to join US universities and the corporate sector. Similarly, in Britain, the Tory government created eight new universities to close the gap in scientific knowledge.The developed world is fully aware that the forward (higher education) linkages of education rest on the edifice of its backward (school) linkages. Thus the public school system in the developed world, including the US, is extremely good. Indeed, budget outlay on education is often an election agenda in those countries.In the late 90s Tony Blair fought the national election on the agenda of strengthening school education. Immediately after his election for the second term, he declared in May 2001 \u201cour top priority will be education, education, education \u2026 to make Britain a learning society\u201d. He further said \u201cschoolchildren \u2026 ought to learn the joy of life, exhilaration of music, excitement of sports, the beauty of art, the magic of science\u201d.The objective was to groom children essentially with a renaissance foundation, avoiding narrow specialisation. Graduation ceremonies in Western universities always stress the societal commitment to education. For individual students, it\u2019s indeed a memorable event where parents, friends and relatives celebrate. In India, over and above those broad educational goals, children should also be exposed to the glorious tradition of the country. That will ensure that the Indian variant of renaissance is ingrained in its history.To indicate how committed a society is towards children\u2019s education, take two instances. In Japan, for years there used to be just one passenger every day waiting at the Kya-Shirataki station on the island of Hokkaido \u2013 a high school girl on her way to class. Recently, in Kottayam, Kerala, a government-owned 70-seater boat on successive days ferried a girl alone from the waterlogged stretch of Alappuzha to Kanjiram, just to ensure that she wouldn\u2019t miss her Class XI examination.The countries of North America, Europe and China are at the apex today not only on the basis of their \u2018hard (military) power\u2019, but also on the basis of their \u2018soft power\u2019 based on knowledge. That \u2018soft power\u2019, apart from knowledge endowment, also embraces culture, art, music, film etc. Bismarck could not ensure a German hegemony through only \u2018coal and iron\u2019, he also had the \u2018soft power\u2019 of Marx, Freud, Max Weber, Beethoven or Einstein. In the Indian context, one can mention the names of Homi Bhabha, Srinivasa Ramanujan, Amartya Sen, Ravi Shankar, Satyajit Ray, and Zubin Mehta and others who have raised the esteem of India as a \u2018soft\u2019 knowledge power.In the context of a knowledge society, it\u2019s also necessary to revisit Jacques Delors who authored the 1996 Unesco Report on Education. It identified a number of tensions for the people, generated by technological, economic, and social change \u2013 between \u201cglobal and local; the universal and the particular; tradition and modernity; the spiritual and the material; the need for competition and the ideal of equality of opportunity\u201d.

I therefore, opine that the Union of India must challenge the said award and must file all available proceedings to challenge the award and/or to protect the interest of Union of India,\" Mehta said in his opinion.Mehta said India should explore a competent forum in Singapore and advised against approaching the Delhi high court or the Supreme Court. \"From the award, it appears that the seat of arbitration is Singapore and prime facie the challenge may lie in the said arbitration before the municipal courts of Singapore,\" the SG suggested.Two months after Vodafone won the taxation dispute in the SC in January 2012, the Centre had amended the tax laws retrospectively and, in 2013, it slapped the telecom giant with a tax demand of Rs 13,000 crore.Sources said India has to move fast to challenge the award in an appropriate forum keeping in mind the period of limitation that would be attached to the award. The SG suggested that the future course of action be charted in consultation with attorney general K K Venugopal.When the law ministry referred the SG's opinion to the AG and sought his view, Venugopal recused from the process saying he was \"prohibited from advising the government in this case by the rules of conflict of interest\".The AG, in his letter to the law ministry, said, \"I was consulted by Vodafone International Holdings BV in regard to the same dispute much before I was appointed to the office of attorney general for India.

Among other things, the RBI has fixed the minimum net-owned fund (NOF) for commencing housing finance business at Rs 20 crore and specified a timeline for meeting the NOF by the existing HFCs with lesser capital.\"The guidelines also make HFCs equal to NBFC (non-banking financial company) guidelines in terms of net-owned funds, exposure to individual and group companies, risk capital, liquidity etc,\" said Kuntal Sur, financial risk and regulation leader, PwC.He added that these measures will make HFCs stronger in risk management, governance and financially sound. \"RBI has also given a transition timeline and specific criterion for transition. With the adherence of these, HFCs will be in a better position to withstand market turbulence.\"Commenting on another aspect of the revised regulation that HFCs will not be allowed to impose prepayment charges, ANAROCK Property Consultants Chairman Anuj Puri said it would provide relief to the borrowers.\"Usually, HFCs charge penalty anywhere between 1-4 per cent on the outstanding principle.

But I am sceptical of the US government\u2019s move to prosecute and break up Google, claiming advertisers and viewers are harmed by its being \u201cthe unchallenged gateway to the internet for billions of users worldwide\u201d.Google gets only 29% of digital advertising, followed by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, and new internet stars like TikTok. Google is simply not an \u201cunchallenged gateway\u201d, though it is the dominant search engine. The historical argument against monopoly is price gouging. But the internet giants typically offer free news, entertainment, and knowledge. This can create problems of privacy and hate speech but is the opposite of price gouging.A brilliant policy paper by Ryan Bourne of the Cato Institute, \u2018Is This Time Different\u2019, shows that anti-monopoly cases can end farcically, with the supposed monopoly being ousted by new innovations. Economist Joseph Schumpeter said the \u201ccreative destruction\u201d of innovation constantly killed established giants, creating new ones. Innovation, rather than government controls on market share, was the key killer of monopolies.IBM seemed a classic monopolist in mainframe computers in the 1970s. An anti-trust case against IBM lasted 13 years but then collapsed since the personal computer and laptop killed IBM\u2019s supposed mainframe monopoly. They are in turn threatened by the smartphone.Is Amazon a retail monopoly? Please recall A&P, the US retail monopolist from the 1910s to 1960s. By creating the chain store, it beat traditional retailers hollow, and had greater market share than its four nearest rivals. Yet A&P was eventually trounced by big-box supermarkets like Walmart, which in turn are now threatened by e-commerce. Once-mighty A&P filed for bankruptcy in 2010.Facebook is often called a monopolist. But back in 2007, The Guardian had an article titled \u2018Will MySpace Ever Lose its Monopoly?\u2019 MySpace had 74% of social network traffic in 2008, and \u201cnetwork effects\u201d supposedly made it impregnable. Facebook disproved that. It too can be decimated by a newcomer with superior technology. When will the rival come? Nobody knows, but as in IBM\u2019s case, new rivals could come long before an anti-monopoly case ends, wasting government and corporate time and money.In November 2007, Forbes magazine\u2019s cover story on Nokia was \u2018One Billion Customers \u2014 Can Anyone Catch the Cellphone King?\u2019 This was, of course, written just as Apple and Samsung began their mighty ascent, and Nokia its long descent. Microsoft ultimately bought Nokia in 2013 when its market share was 3%.Kodak dominated cameras and photo films for decades, and in 1978 was labelled a monopolist by a US jury. This happened just as it was losing market share to Nikon, Olympus, and Fujifilm. The digital camera then decimated all of them, and in turn was decimated by the smartphone.Apple pioneered iTunes for music download sales and got a market share exceeding 80%. In 2010, the British music magazine NME asked, \u2018Who will Break iTunes\u2019 Monopoly?\u2019 The US government began an anti-monopoly inquiry. But iTunes was soon disrupted by streaming services like Spotify and Pandora. Later, consumers got free music from many sites such as YouTube.In 1996, 90% of internet users had Netscape as their browser. It seemed unstoppable. Yet by 2001 its market share fell to 12%, decimated by Microsoft\u2019s Internet Explorer. Through its Windows system, Microsoft made Internet Explorer the default browser for millions. Harvard Business School Professor Pai-Ling Yin called this unassailable. Yet by 2008 Mozilla began gaining market share, and then all were overtaken by Google\u2019s Chrome.Xerox was once so dominant in photocopying that the very act was called \u201cXeroxing\u201d. An anti-trust suit in 1973 led to a costly legal struggle. But then rivals like HP, Canon and Minolta emerged with better, cheaper copiers. Today Xerox is an also-ran.Yahoo once dominated search engines. Google did not invent the search engine: it was 35th in line. In 1998, Fortune published a piece, \u2018How Yahoo won the Search Wars\u2019. As usual, this happened just as Yahoo\u2019s fortunes were declining and Google\u2019s rising. Google today has 90% of the market. Should it be broken up as a monopolist?History suggests this will be dicey, unnecessary, and maybe farcical.This column began by saying that some aspects of the internet giants (including Google) should be regulated.

As you know, we have launched an ambitious plan to expand our chemicals, petrochemicals, derivatives and industrial base in Abu Dhabi and I look forward to exploring partnerships with even more Indian companies across our hydrocarbon value chain,\" Al Jaber said.ADNOC in 2018 unveiled plans to invest $45 billion with partners to develop its local downstream activities, including the expansion of its Ruwais refinery and petrochemical capacity in the industrial hub.The company has courted international investors to expand its oil and gas production and monetise its assets.\"India's remarkable growth as an economic power has cemented its place as one of the world's largest energy consumers.\"In fact, it represents the second biggest market for ADNOC. This is a position we hope to build on, in line with the huge expansion of India's ambitions for growth,\" Al Jaber said.ADNOC, he said, is ready to meet India's growing demand across the full portfolio of products.He added ADNOC is proud to be a key supplier to India's Strategic Petroleum Reserves and is keen to expand the commercial scale and scope of this strategic reserves partnership.ADNOC was the first foreign company to hire space at the underground crude oil storage India has built as an insurance against supply and price disruptions.\"In the past two years, ADNOC has enhanced its strategic energy links with India \u2013 a key growth market for crude, refined and petrochemical products. In addition to its partnership in the strategic reserves program, ADNOC is also a stakeholder in one of India's largest refinery and petrochemical projects, to be constructed on India's west coast,\" he said.ADNOC along with Saudi Aramco have together taken a 50 per cent interest in the massive 60 million tonnes a year refinery-cum-petrochemical complex planned on Maharashtra coast at a cost of $44 billion.Concluding his remarks, Al Jaber said he believes both countries have only scratched the surface of the opportunities that could benefit both India and the UAE in the energy sector, the statement said.\"I believe that by seizing these opportunities, we can in fact enhance the speed of post-Covid economic recovery. I very much look forward to expanding our relationship across multiple areas and I am absolutely certain that we can remove any barriers that may stand in our way,\" he said.The objective of the roundtable is to deliver a global platform to understand best practices, discuss reforms, and inform strategies for accelerating investments into the Indian oil and gas value chain.Indian companies have steadily increased their participation in the UAE's energy sector. In March 2019, a consortium of two Indian oil companies were awarded the exploration rights for an onshore block in Abu Dhabi.

The sides split amid a civil war in 1949 and China considers Taiwan its own territory to brought under its control by force if necessary.\"The purchase of these weapons will enhance Taiwan's credible combat capabilities and asymmetric combat capabilities,\" Shih told reporters at a briefing, using a term for countering a much stronger foe with precision weapons and advanced tactics. \"This will also enhance our overall combat capabilities to contribute to maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait .\"The Trump administration on Monday notified Congress of plans for the Harpoon system, whose missiles are capable of striking ships and land targets.

Presidential candidate Joseph Biden has promised that if elected, he would build a \u201cunited front of US allies and partners to confront China\u2019s abusive behaviours\u201d.Are the US allies willing to confront China in security and economic domains? Germany, Japan, Asean and many other countries have a robust economic relationship with China, whose benefits they are unwilling to sacrifice while maintaining their security ties with the US. EU countries do not have any adverse security relationship with China. Italy, Greece, several Central and East European members of EU are tied with China in Belt and Road and other advantageous initiatives.The US was alone in applying sanctions on China for imposing a national security law in Hong Kong; most of its allies did not join it even in criticising China, fearing adverse impact on their trade relations. Trust of allies in Europe and East Asia in the US has waned after Trump\u2019s erratic leadership and US\u2019s withdrawal from the Paris climate change agreement, Iran nuclear deal and other hotspots without consulting them, bickering over security issues and imposition of tariffs on the EU countries. France and Germany have moved away from a US centric world order to greater reliance on their own efforts and maintaining a distinct relationship with China; similarly, Japan, Australia and Asean countries are shoring up their own security against a rising China.Trump\u2019s tariffs on China\u2019s exports did not produce the desired impact as the US authorities could not substitute imports of many items (eg iPhones, consumer goods) from third countries, unlike China which took good care not to impose tariffs on those products for which the US was the only or desirable source (eg semiconductors, pharmaceuticals).Similarly, the US sanctions on export of semiconductors and microchips did not succeed, as China was able to source these from third countries like South Korea and Taiwan . Tariffs and sanctions will be successful only if these are applied after a meticulous examination of alternatives by all US partners collectively.Will the new US president be able to persuade his partners to impose common tariffs or sanctions on China to end its unfair trade practices or bar export of sensitive technologies? It is difficult to say with what success; allies without any adverse security relationship with Beijing, whose economies are still mired in recession, may be hesitant to take such extreme steps.The post-Covid world of January 2021, when the new US president takes over, will be very different from 2016 when the Obama-Biden duo left. China\u2019s ability to control the virus and resume its high growth trajectory has further widened the existing differential between itself and other major powers; China is expected to grow by 2% in 2020 while most other major economies would contract. As per Lowy Institute, Australia, the US and Japan will take until 2024 and 2027 respectively to recover to the 2019 levels of economic activity. India\u2019s economy by 2030 would be only 40% of China\u2019s GDP, down from the 50% forecast in 2019.The rising China poses an immediate challenge to the territorial integrity and security of many countries; its unfair policies have aided China\u2019s rapid economic development at the expense of others. China has resorted to punitive attacks against South Korea, Japan and Australia and recently India for not following its diktat. The free world has to come together to push back China\u2019s aggression to safeguard their societies.The next US president will be confronted with these challenges as he outlines a strategy to counter an aggressive and combative China. India with its growing economy, large professional armed forces and a determination to resist China\u2019s onslaught, could be a strong partner to push back China\u2019s abusive behaviours.

{"More to Delhi\u2019s pollution than crop burning": [["More to Delhi\u2019s pollution than crop burning", "For most days in the year, air quality in Delhi, India\u2019s capital, does not meet the norms set out in the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. This year the situation was slightly different with pollution levels dropping low due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown followed by a good rainy season. But then 2020 is an unusual year. Delhi experienced a reduction of 41 to 53 percent of particulate matter pollution during the lockdown period. In the three preceding years, only 6 per cent of days met the norms for particulate matter and other pollutants\u2014those days were inevitably during the monsoon or rainy season.Poor air quality is an everyday problem in Delhi, but its residents, by extension the government, only seem to react when the air gets visibly poor with the city enveloped in smog and the air perceptibly toxic. That is generally during onset of the winter season that is, October and November.For about three to four weeks during this period, Delhi\u2019s already poor air quality gets an additional influx of particulate matter as farmers in the northern states of Punjab and Haryana burn paddy crop residue to clear the land quickly in time for sowing the winter wheat crop. \u201cPunjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh produce nearly 40 million tonnes of paddy straw every year. Punjab alone produces about 22 to 23 million tonnes. Most of which is burnt,\u201d says Sucha Singh Gill of the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development, Chandigarh. Cooling temperatures and other meteorological conditions such as lower boundary layer height, calmer post monsoon winds, and high relative humidity aid the movement of the particulate matter produced by burning towards the Delhi and the western Indo-Gangetic Plain.It is in this period, almost like an annual ritual, that air pollution becomes a matter of public concern and conversation and then forgotten once the skies clear. \u201cOne reason why crop burning is so large in the imagination is because it is period when we have the spikes when the air is visibly polluted and the level of particulate matter rise to say 10 times the safe limits but even on a day when we can see blue skies the air is polluted, say two or three times the safe limit,\u201d said Navroz Dubash, professor at the Centre for Policy Research, a New Delhi-based think tank.Over the last few years, political parties have been wading into the seasonal conversation on pollution. This has been more in the nature of a pre-emptive blame game and the inevitable strike back. Agricultural stubble burning is the main focus, the lack of effort and progress in addressing perennial or year-long sources of pollution, particularly those within Delhi\u2019s airshed are overlooked. This fits in with the general approach, in government and outside, to tackling pollution\u2014it is episodic and more concerned with dealing with the spikes.Crop residue, Dubash explained, contributes to the spike in air pollution \u201cwhen even the healthy start feeling unwell\u201d. But it is far from the only or even the biggest source of pollution in National Capital Territory of Delhi. Crop burning is literally the straw the broke the camel\u2019s back. Source apportionment studies by the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (2015), The Energy and Resources Institute (2018) and the Automotive Research Association of India (2018) all found that major sources of particulate matter pollution (PM2.5 and PM10) during the winter months were biomass and garbage burning in the city, vehicular emission, secondary compounds, industry, and road, construction and demolition dust. Given the episodic nature of crop burning, its share for season works out to 5 per cent\u2014though continuous monitoring on some days it can contribute as much as 44 per cent to the city\u2019s PM2.5 load.This year, till now, the highest contribution of crop burning to the city\u2019s pollution has been 19 per cent (on two days in the last fortnight that is October 10 to 26). The share has been at less than 10 per cent for 9 days going as low as 1 per cent. What is notable is that number of fires have been for the most part higher than in 2019 or 2018.By limiting the efforts to curb pollution to crop residue burning has meant that Delhi and the national capital region have been devoting their efforts to tackling a 5 per cent problem while neglecting the 95 per cent. \u201cIf you are looking at averages then crop residue burning contributes around 5 per cent to Delhi's air pollution. But on particular days in the season, those with the highest number of fires, the contribution can be as high as 40 per cent,\u201d said Sumit Sharma, Director, Earth Science and Climate Change Division at The Energy and Research Institute (TERI), a New Delhi-based think tank.Crop residue burning is one part of the problem. A seasonal source of particulate matter pollution, crop residue burning is a demonstration of why environmental concerns such as air quality cannot be addressed in isolation and there are no easy or quick solutions.Paddy was not traditionally grown in Punjab and Haryana given its high water requirement. In her study on crop residue burning in Punjab. Niti Gupta, a research analyst with the New Delhi-based think tank Council for Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), writes that paddy requires at least 18 mm of water per day for almost 100 days compared to 500 mm required for wheat during the entire growth season.The Green Revolution and the introduction of high yield hybrid seeds changed things. Policies began to be geared towards encouraging paddy cultivation. Punjab average rainfall is about 650 mm, of which 500 mm falls in the rainy season between July to September. But this isn\u2019t adequate for paddy cultivation the shortfall, which researchers put at 1,100 mm per hectare, is made up by drawing groundwater. The government\u2019s policy of providing farmers with free electricity meant that farmers could meet their water requirement for cultivating paddy.By the 1980s, government was procuring 80 per cent of the rice produced. The assured market structure along with a minimum support policy that supported the cultivation of non-basmati high yielding varieties of rice made paddy cultivation lucrative. Its high remunerative value meant improved incomes, making the farmers of these two states relatively better off than their counterparts elsewhere. Farmers in the region shifted from a maize-wheat crop mix to wheat-paddy.In the mid-1980s, the farmers adopted mechanised harvesting. A move that reduced the amount of time they had to spend in the fields thereby allowing them to increase land under cultivation. The area under paddy cultivation increased from 1183 thousand hectare in 1980-81 to 3103 thousand hectare in 2018-19 while the area under cultivation of crops traditionally grown in the region such as maize and pulses declined. Between 1980-81 and 2018-19 area under maize cultivation declined from 382 to 109 thousand hectares, while area under pulses declined from 341 thousand hectares in 1980-81 to 20 thousand hectares in 2016-17.The mechanical combines used for harvesting left behind stalks with inbound roots. The stalk of the wheat crop can be cleared by allowing the livestock to feed on it, The paddy residue is burnt because its high silica content makes it unsuitable for livestock feed. But the burning did not rise to the level of a problem for air quality in the Indo-Gangetic plain.That changed when the indiscriminate withdrawal of ground water led to a crisis. Ground water withdrawal was outpacing the recharge rate. As Gupta explained, \u201cIf the rice-wheat monoculture remains, the water table in central Punjab is expected to fall below 70 feet in 66 per cent of the area by 2023, below 100 feet in 34 per cent of the area, and much below 130 feet in 7 per cent of the area.\u201dThe Punjab state government was staring at an ecological crisis. But given the centrality of paddy to the prosperity of the state\u2019s farmers and their political power, the state government had to find an option that would address the water crisis without abandoning paddy cultivation.In 2008-09, the state government introduced the Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act synchronising the paddy crop with the monsoon season. Farmers could no longer cultivate paddy through the year. The decision to restrict paddy cultivation to the monsoon season was done to limit ground water usage. \u201cThe new system meant a later sowing and harvest season for paddy, and an extremely short gap between the paddy harvest and the winter sowing season. Burning became the quickest and the most viable option for clearing the land. And the unfavourable meteorological conditions of the post monsoon period meant that the burning particulates would be transported to Delhi and western Indo-Gangetic Plains,\u201d said Vibha Dhawan, Distinguished Fellow at TERI.The assured market structure and the MSP regime for non-basmati paddy meant that paddy continued to be a lucrative crop. Farmers are unwilling to give it up, and politicians understood the heavy electoral price they would pay if they restricted paddy cultivation. At the same time the impact on air quality could not be ignored. Faced with an emergency, the focus shifted to managing the paddy crop residue.In 2017, the central government set up a task force on biomass management under the aegis of the NITI Aayog, the government\u2019s think tank. The aim was to curb the practice of crop residue burning by encouraging and enabling farmers to use the residue for mulching or to sell the residue as feedstock for power generation.As part of this effort, the Confederation of Indian Industries Foundation carried out pilot interventions across 19 villages in the Ludhiana and Patiala districts of Punjab to encourage farmers to use the paddy straw for mulching\u2014a process by which the stalk residue is mechanically cut and then spread over the field in time disintegrating to function like manure. This process and the subsequent sowing require specialised equipment. To encourage farmers to make the shift, the central government in 2018 announced an agricultural mechanisation scheme with total fund of Rs 1,152 crore for 2018-19 and 2019-20. This money was for subsiding machines to help remove the crop stubble without burning.The results have been mixed. Farmers point to lack of equipment\u2014too few compared to the need. Equipment manufacturers hiked their process, making the subsidy given to farmers for buying the machinery inadequate. Seema Arora, deputy director general, CII, who was involved with the pilot interventions says resolving the crop burning problem \u201cwill require addressing the issue from the farmers\u2019 perspective. It is more than making equipment available to farmers\u201d. Arora points to the need to train farmers to enable them to make the changes in agricultural practice that technological interventions necessarily require. \u201cIt has to be about behaviour change and that can happen when farmers realise that investment required to move away from burning residue is yielding returns. In effect, the farmer must be prepared to deal with the change in ecosystem,\u201d stresses Arora.Long-term solution will require revisiting cropping patterns. Given the problems of a receding water table, it seems clear that Punjab-Haryana farmer must move away from cultivating paddy. However, the pricing and incentives structure is not conducive to this shift. Though the government has substantially increased the minimum support price for crops such as coarse grains, maize, and pulses farmers in the region are unwilling to shift. They say that the returns are low, and cultivating paddy, despite the problems, continues make economic sense.Dhawan says that farmers will not shift away from paddy till the other crops such as coarse grains and pulses yield higher incomes. Instead she suggests \u201cdeveloping and popularising an early maturing variety of rice. This will ensure that farmers have a month for harvesting, and this would reduce the need to burn stubble.\u201dAt the same time, Dhawan says that \u201cthe government must create the necessary technological infrastructure for farmers to access the equipment necessary to shift from the practice of crop residue burning. Effectively, the government needs to approach this as an infrastructure investment akin to building roads. And finally, there is a need to invest in an ecosystem that encourages diversification of crops, focusing on those save water and improve nutrition content, and in the technological changes that will permit a more sustainable agricultural practice.\u201dGill suggests creating economic value for the paddy straw, by using it as feedstock for biofuel. For Gill, the in-situ disposal of paddy straw by mulching is a waste of resource that could bring extra income to the farmers and meet fuel and energy needs.Sumit Sharma agrees with Gill. He argues that creating economic value for the crop residue will put an end to stubble burning. He says, \u201cwe need to focus on converting the crop stubble into useful energy, so that it becomes a revenue earning option for farmers. Right now the focus is on encouraging mulching, and for that farmers incur a certain cost, so they see it as eating into their profits. The technology for ex situ utilisation is there, some pilots have been conducted but the business model to take it to scale is not there yet\u2014who will pay for collection, how do you transport the stubble, storing and utilisation.\u201dTackling crop residue burning will require a systemic and long-term effort. This includes economically viable and profitable uses for the stubble, so that farmers see it as a resource and not a nuisance. Considering the impact of burning on soil productivity and health, and human health in these communities and getting farmers in Punjab-Haryana to cultivating crops such as maize. This will require policy interventions, increased awareness, and economic opportunities.At the same time, downwind areas that is Delhi and the national capital region have to focus on reducing the pollution load in their region as well. This will require greater focus on reducing road dust and construction and demolition dust, as well as pollution from industrial sources. As Dubash puts it, \u201cwe have to understand air pollution as 5 times 20 problem. There are 20 buckets of things and we have to address them all to solve Delhi\u2019s air pollution problem.\u201d(This story has been updated.

{"Nifty may find support at 5300 level": [["Nifty may find support at 5300 level", "(Bhavin Desai is Manager (derivatives), Motilal Oswal Securities )\n\nThe Nifty started Wednesday\u2019s trade on a rather timid note. As the underlying index was quietly drifting downwards, the futures started trading at a deeper discount of nearly 10 points.It was the last hour of trade that saw better volumes and a sharp movement. The fall amid global uncertainties has brought the Nifty once again to the level of 5400. Even the participation seems to be a little scared, as Nifty futures ended the day\u2019s trade with an addition of over a million shares in open interest indicating creation of hedges.As far as stock futures are concerned, we are very near to the highest-ever open interest with 195 crore shares in open interest. With nearly 70% of the stocks still trading with a premium, the bias among participants seems to be upwards. This would create a bit of pressure on the market in case of any macro uncertainty.As we are almost half way through to expiry, it makes sense to continue with long positions, but along with long puts simultaneously so that losses are capped, still keeping all the upside open.On the options side, Nifty August series open interest put-call ratio is at 1:58, indicating a moderately bullish composition. Even the implied volatilities element of the options which indicate the assumption of the risk remains very low. This indicates we may not see a huge downside as far as the August expiry is concerned. With over 10 million shares in 5300 August Put, the Nifty may find support around the level of 5300.We feel one can do a Nifty bear ratio spread to hedge trading longs, by buying 1 lot Nifty August 5400 PE & selling 2 lots of Nifty August 5300 PE.This strategy accrues profit within the 5200 & 5400 range in case the Nifty ends up in this range on expiry. On the event the Nifty heads upwards to close above 5400, one can still have a cash inflow and no cost of hedging. The strategy does incur loss below 5200, which we feel shall hold good for the August expiry."], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}
{"Seven out of top 10 Asian small-cap funds are Indian": [["Seven out of top 10 Asian small-cap funds are Indian", "Indian funds have grabbed seven out of the top 10 spots in the league table of leading small-cap funds across Asia , thanks to some canny stock-picking amid growing investor appetite for cheap stocks with potential to deliver multi-bagger returns.An analysis of nearly 300 Asian small-cap schemes shows DSP BlackRock Micro Cap Fund leading the charge, delivering an 82% return over the past year. Managed by Vinit Sambre, who has been with DSP BlackRock for a little over three years, this fund has also soundly beaten the 58% rise of BSE\u2019s Small-Cap Index since August 2009. The 30-share benchmark Sensex has gained 20% during this period while the wider BSE 500 Index is up 27%.The other six schemes \u2014 Sundaram BNP Paribas Select Small Cap Franklin India Smaller Companies and ING Vysya CUB \u2014 have given investors returns between 44% and 57% on a trailing 12-month basis. These schemes manage anywhere between `46 crore and `954 crore.Four of these funds were launched during the peak of the previous bull run between January 2007 and March 2008, and investors in them have also had to endure a massive erosion in their initial investment in the downturn that followed.Mutual fund tracking firm Value Research called the DSP fund as an impressive product in the entire \u201csmall-cap universe\u201d, noting that the stocks held by it were \u201ccredible, known names and there is a marked absence of momentum in the portfolio\u201d. The fund\u2019s holding includes companies with a high return on equity and strong leadership niches in their industries.Value Research CEO Dhirendra Kumar said the closed-ended nature of some of these funds helped them weather the market turbulence. \u201cThese funds did not face redemption pressures through the declining phase. This, in turn helped them invest for the longer term,\u201d he said.The DSP fund became open-ended in June this year and fund manager Mr Sambre has kept nearly 10% of his `311-crore corpus in cash to meet potential redemptions and to latch onto any opportunity in the market.There are 10 small-cap funds in India, which manage roughly `3,450 crore in stocks. These account for just 2% of the total AUM under equity schemes.Market experts say that as many large-cap stocks became fully priced and relatively unattractive over the past year, the rally shifted to small caps. Stocks such as cooler maker Symphony and luggage maker VIP Industries have led the small-cap charge in the market. Ahmedabad-based Symphony has surged 830% while VIP has risen 548% in the past 12 months.

{"Inflation reflects growth dynamics in India: Christopher Wood": [["Inflation reflects growth dynamics in India: Christopher Wood", "Key note address delivered by Christopher Wood , equity strategist, CLSA, in his first public appearance in India , at the ET Now Market Summit-2010. Excerpts:\n\nHello everybody and thank you for asking me. I will be running through some charts which were still first with the situation in the West. Then I will move on to charts on Asia and India. So I get the bad news out of way first. But this seems to be the wrong way around. So I am getting from back to front here. ( Watch To start with the US situation, this is a big picture chart everybody needs to be aware of in the global economy. This is US total debt as a percentage of GDP. The story is very simple and the total amount of debt in the system in the US has been going down ever since the credit crisis erupted in 2007-2008. This the first time total debt has been falling in America since the Great Depression.Mr Bernanke of the Federal Reserve has been trying to get the re-leveraging game going so far, they have not succeeded. My operating assumption is to assume that the leveraging will continue that we peaked out in the US super credit cycle in 2007, which has been running since the Second World War and now in a long-term de-leveraging cycle, which means lower trend GDP growth.May be re-leveraging will kick in coming months in which case I will change my view, but for now I am assuming it's a de-leveraging cycle until the data proves otherwise. Next chart you see US total net credit market borrowings and you can see the rate of growth of borrowing has been going down in the system despite the big kick up in Federal Government borrowing.Next chart is a long-term trend in US nominal GDP 10-year compound annual growth. As the Japanese example has shown in the last 20 years, when you get into a deflationary environment, it no longer makes sense to look at real GDP measures because when inflation zero level what gives a more realistic picture of what is going is nominal GDP. And in my view, nominal GDP growth in America will continue to trend down. We have seen a big rally in US government bond prices this year, as telling you the trend nominal GDP growth is lower and that means the trend earnings growth, trend revenue growth in America is also going to be lower.Then next chart relates to the consumption story in America which in my view is going to remain anaemic. In my view the US consumers, western consumers in general, are going to be increasing savings rate. There is also a demographic kicking in... the baby boom as heading for retirement, but they cannot afford to retire.So topline is US real disposable personal income, the bottom line is real personal income excluding current transfer receipts. Transfer receipts basically mean welfare payments. So you can see without all the stimulus from the government the fundamental income trend is much weaker. What separates the emerging markets from the developed world is an emerging markets like India with healthy income growth and the developed countries, be it the US, Japan, Europe, we do not have healthy income growth.Next chart highlights a significant rally in US Treasury Bond prices reflected in declining treasury bond yields which has happened this year. At the start of this year the biggest bearish consensus amongst global equity investors was that US Treasury bonds were screaming sells.Everybody said that the treasury bond market is going to collapse, the Fed printing money inflation is coming back. Clearly that consensus was completely wrong. US Treasury Bond market has been rallying even with the recent pick in the S&P and recent weeks up to 1150 level which I think was a peak of this counter trend rally. Even with the stock market rally the bond market did not sell off. What this bond market is telling you is that nominal GDP growth is slowing in America, it is telling you it is not a normal recovery. The credit multiplier is not working.Once the inventory cycles happen & the US capex cycle has ran through, there will be nothing left to sustain the economic momentum. So in a deflationary environment, government bond prices are lead indicator of nominal GDP growth. Right now this is a very important point because the US bond market is sending one message and the US stock market is sending another message and basically investors have a decision to make - do they believe the bond market is giving the correct signal or the stock market? My assumption is that it\u2019s the bond market and my experience is that the bond market is no way smarter than the stock market 90% of the time. Meanwhile, this is US headline CPI inflation for the rest of this year we are going to see inflationary pressures falling throughout the world in the West. That\u2019s going to lead to new deflation concerns.In Asia and countries like China and India, falling inflationary pressures are going to be bullish and everybody is going to realise it does not make sense to worry about inflation in countries like India. The good news is that you have inflation because that reflects the fundamental growth dynamic. But the key point about the US is if the trend over the past 3 months has extrapolated forward, US CPI inflation will turn negative in October. If that happens, it\u2019s not going to be bullish for equities, it\u2019s going to be bullish for government bonds and it\u2019s going to be a signal for Mr. Bernanke, if we have not done that already, to assume quantitative easing.Next chart, US average duration of unemployment. So basically there are large groups of the structurally unemployed in America. So in this sense, the US is heading for the European systems situation were you have a large group of structurally unemployed living off the welfare state. The problem in America is that the welfare state is much more controversial than in Europe, hence the political divide in America, hence the growing trend under the so-called Tea Party movement.Meanwhile the classic monetary measures are highlighting the fact that we are not in a re-leveraging cycle, we are still in a deleveraging cycle. This is the US money multiplier representing the velocity of money in circulation. Velocity of money in circulation is declining. So long as that line is declining, it\u2019s deflationary. We don\u2019t have to worry about inflation picking up, and this chart highlights the growing deflationary threat.Next chart is US broad money supply growth. Again, money supply growth is going down. That\u2019s why the bond market\u2019s rallying, that\u2019s why inflation is not an issue, that\u2019s why Mr. Bernanke is now looking for an excuse to resume quantitative easing.Next chart is US bank lending. Again, no real sign of any kind of meaningful pick up in bank lending annualise lending loan growth continue to slow another indication of a deleveraging cycle. This is not just about banks restricting credit, it is also about a change in psychology, economic agents be it the companies or consumers have become more risk averse about borrowing.Next chart is US total securitisation issuance. In the recent credit boom before the bust a large part of the credit cycle was driven by securitization, therefore we are going to get re-leveraging in America. We need to see a healthy pick up in securitisation as well as banking lending, but the only area that has picked up since the crisis is the dark blue line here.This is agency mortgage bank securities, that\u2019s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These entities are guaranteed by the Federal Government and therefore they do not really count. Any private sector securitisation has barely recovered. Meanwhile the huge role played by Fannie and Freddie should not be ignored in terms of supporting the housing market.Basically about 96% of the America mortgage market now is government guaranteed. So that's the US situation. The big picture is still deflationary. However, in terms of macroeconomic shocks that could cause another steep fall in global equities this year for the rest of 2010, I still believe there is going to be another sharp decline in equities like we saw in April and May. It\u2019s more likely to be triggered by the Eurozone where you have systemic risk relating to government debt.So this chart relates to the ECBs net buying of Euroland government bonds. The key point here is this ECB was forced reluctantly to stop buying junk government bonds in Europe like Greek government bonds in May when the Greek crisis blew up. The interesting point is the ECB is only doing this reluctantly and as equity markets have rallied and the credit spreads have come in, the ECB has progressively bought less and less junk government paper.Basically last week they hardly bought anything \u2013 they\u2019re probably going to go down to zero just as this counter trend rally peaks.How early we go down depends on whether there is another bout of risk aversion or markets are just focusing on waning growth. This is Greek and PIG government bond yield spreads. I was recommending for several years the investor should bet on wise widening PIG spread. PIG spread, for people who don\u2019t know this, is the average bond yield of Portugal, Ireland, Greece, Spain over the German bond yields-I closed out that just about when the Greek crisis peaked. And I think a better trade is going forward is what I called a Spanish flu trade, betting on rising Spanish CDS.For now the jury doubts on whether these European countries can make the fiscal adjustments being demanded by the Germans, but people should understand that the Germans have a completely diametrically opposite view to the Americans - they simply do not believe that fiscally stimulating is the way to get yourself out of the economic problem. So right now the weaker part of Euroland has embarked on a fiscal adjustments which is intrinsically deflationary, given the downturn they are facing.The stress test is being led by Ireland. Last year the Irish economy contracted in nominal terms by more than 10 percentage points. So far the Irish are taking the pain probably because the only boom they have had in the last 1000 years was when they join Euroland community. So in that sense willing to take quite a lot of pain, but in the big stress test it is going to be Spain.Spain is a big important country. They had a massive private sector debt binge, they got the biggest housing bust in the west, even bigger than the US. So it is going to be interesting to see whether the Spanish political system can make this fiscal adjustment, given the fact they already have nearly 20% unemployed. I have an open mind on this. We just have to see what happens and may be the Europeans can make this fiscal adjustment, in which case it\u2019s going to be a lot of pain, but the Euro as a currency is going to merge with huge credibility.On the other hand, it may well be that this level of fiscal austerity is simply incompatible with the political systems of these Mediterranean countries. Right now, it is impossible to tell the European who is watching the football and now at the beach we can have a much better ideas they can take this pain by about January-February next year.But in the meantime if the markets will test or are bound to test the European\u2019s willingness to take this fiscal adjustment in the next few months. Tactically I would be selling the Euro against the dollar here as we had a significant bounce back in the Euro. So those are my thoughts on basically the West. It\u2019s a deflationary environment. But in the US we are going to continue to stimulate in the Europeans because the Europe\u2019s case is going to follow the German President.Turning to Asia, Asia is a fundamentally healthy story unlike the West. In my view, the peak of the Asia ex-Japan index you saw prior to the credit crisis will be exceeded sooner or later because the Asian economies are growing healthily and have effectively decoupled from the West even though the markets haven\u2019t. This is MSCI Asia ex-Japan relative to MSCI world index. They\u2019ve been in & outperforming trend since the bottom of the Asian crisis in 1998 and that outperforming trend is resuming when the Chinese stock tightening and then formally start easing again which will happen in the next few months. That will reaccelerate Asian outperformance.Valuation wise, Asia is trading in line with the US on the 12-month forward PE basis. In my view, sooner or later Asia is going to trade at a sustainable premium over the West because the fundamental growth story is so superior. In terms of my relative return asset allocation, I\u2019m going to take a detour here. I am structurally overweight on India and Indonesia as these are the two best long-term stories in Asia. But tactically I have reduced India a bit and raised China because we are going to get a policy inflection points in China in the next few months which will be bullish for Chinese stocks.But my big underweight in Asia Pac portfolio is Australia which is why I\u2019m weaving more money into China because it has become cheap. What I am underweight on is those stock, sectors, countries which are perceived as beneficiaries of Chinese growth like the commodities sector, because in my view, Chinese growth is going to be slowing for the rest of this year and that\u2019s a negative headwind for the commodities complex.From an Indian standpoint that was obviously positive. I think oil is going this week to be as high as it\u2019s going to get on its counter trend move. Clearly if you are more bullish on oil, you will be more bearish on India and this is my long only portfolio on Asia or ex-Japan.I started this portfolio beginning of fourth quarter 2002, sent about 25 to 30 stocks in it, mostly large cap. I cannot have any cash and it\u2019s long only and is basically playing the domestic story in Asia as always. Mostly has the biggest weight being in India because India since always has been my favourite equity story in Asia. It\u2019s still got a big weighting in India. We can argue about the details of what stocks to own etc, but fundamentally this has India. Secondly, China if I did not have a big capital orientation, then I would have less in China, more in smaller Asian markets like Indonesia and Philippines.That\u2019s the performance of my long-only portfolio compared with the benchmarks. Since I cannot really have cash, as I said, so I cannot really hedge it, but for those who want to hedge I have been recommending since the middle of over 2007 that investors hedge this long Asian exposure by shorting western financial stocks. I have now narrowed that down in recent months into not shorting western financial stocks, but shorting European financial stocks because European financial stocks are much more geared to the systemic risk from junk European government debt and they are also in a much more leverage than American financial stocks.This is my global portfolio I have also been running since 2002. This has run on a theoretical US dollar denominated pension fund on a 5-year view and this portfolio I have simplified in recent months have got 15% weighting in US 30 year treasury bonds.That might seem crazy to people given the fact that the US government debt is getting bigger & bigger, but one of my views is that the most likely end game is a sovereign debt crisis in the US and the collapse of the US dollar paper standard. I don't think that end game happens this year and in my view before this oust in the game is played out the deflationary pressures in the US will take bond yields much lower. So I think it\u2019s quite possible the 10-year Treasury goes 2%, 30 year treasury goes to 3%. For people who think that\u2019s insane, I should point out that the 10-year GDP went below 1% this week and in 2003 got to 0.45 basis points.So the message is that in deflationary environment bond thing gets very low indeed because the risk aversion causes people like banks, insurance companies, individuals to buy bonds to lock in income because in deflationary environment there is not much income around. So that\u2019s the deflationary hedge, but 45% of my portfolio is geared to the best story in the world, which is Asia.So I got 15% in Asia or ex-Japan physical property, 30% in my long-only Asia or ex-Japan portfolio. Then I got a longstanding position in gold and gold mining stocks which I have since inception of this portfolio and this position in gold is basically hedging for US dollar denominated pension funds. The big picture risk is that one day simply the world revolt against the ongoing US stimulus and there is a sovereign debt crisis in the US dollar, US government debt, which means the end of the US paper standard and the end of the post 1945 Western paper currency system. And in that environment gold can go parabolic. My longstanding target for gold that can peak in this bull market is $35000 per ounce.So this is a gold bullion chart in US dollar terms. The key point about this chart is that it\u2019s quite obvious gold is in a bull market and remains in a bull market and this bull market, when it ends, will end in a parabolic spike which we have not seen yet. The next obvious trigger for the next big move in gold will be the next time Mr. Bernanke adopts quantitative easing and the next time he does it he who is going to have to expand the balance sheet more than the last time (because otherwise people are going to worry if it\u2019s going to work), but cannot do it right now because the news flow is not bad enough.Gold stocks relative to gold bullion price. In my view gold stocks made that relative low to gold bullion price in 2008 when commodities collapsed. So for equity managers who cannot buy pure bullion I would say look at gold mining stocks because if gold goes $35000 per ounce, it is going to be massive operating leverage for those mine. Gold stocks that actually produce gold haven\u2019t hedge the gold and on jurisdictions where governments don\u2019t cease the gold often.I am turning to some Asian Pacific charts. I will just run through few charts on China that\u2019s a big story for everywhere as I say Chinese market has underperformed this year. The key point to understand about Chinese stocks is that they are policy-driven. Indian stocks are earnings-driven while Chinese stocks are policy-driven. The Chinese government is tightening, that is why the market has been going down. When the Chinese government starts easing, the Chinese stocks will go up and then may be outperforming Indian stocks for a period.Real GDP growth in China. China growth peaked in my view first quarter. It\u2019s going to be slowing for the rest of this year probably an annualised growth 12% first quarter, may be down to 1% by the fourth quarter. That is going to create a lot of market noise. It will be negative for commodities. It\u2019s not a big deal, but it will create a lot of noise. Chinese bank landing has slowed dramatically this year from the surge last year. China is a command economy banking system. So that looks dramatic, but that has seen the loan growth slowing to 18% which is still respectable, it\u2019s not cold turkey.China has been tightening on the property market. So what the stock market in China wants to see is more and more developers willing to cut property prices because it\u2019s more than evident that developers are stopping raising prices and starting to cut prices. The greater the hope that the Chinese government stops tightening that process should play out in the next few months. As you can see here average daily residential sales of Chinese properties have fallen pretty dramatically since April when the government got more aggressive on tightening. You\u2019d have read a lot about Chinese property bubbles, especially in America.The Chinese property markets have a lot of excess supply, but it\u2019s not a bubble because you have very conservative mortgage financing. What you do have there is a lot of high end developments sitting 80% empty. So Chinese people like to have lot of flat value and don\u2019t like to have flats once used because they think a used flat is devalued just like a used car.What about the currency? When the renminbi starts to rise against the US dollar incrementally, maximum incremental appreciation will be of 5%. So the Chinese are going to let their currency go up slightly, but you are not going to get any aggressive moves.I got a chart on Hong Kong just to highlight that we have got a big long-term asset inflation story in Asia. The quintessential asset inflation story in Asia is Hong Kong because of the supply constraints. In my view, Hong Kong property would sooner or later exceed 1997 peaks. You can get a mortagage in Hong Kong today for less than 1%. There you see, apart from Mumbai, this is a one property market in Asia with the massive supply constraint. This is a new supplier residential properties. So Hong Kong I think is a classic asset inflation story to monitor.Turning to India, I would not go too much linked to India because everybody over here would know more about it than me, but we probably had a big inflation scare at the start of this year. In my view, it\u2019s fundamentally silly to worry too much about inflationary pressures in Asia.We should be celebrating the fact that there is inflation because if there wasn\u2019t inflationary pressures in Asia, it would mean the world is facing a global depression because there is no growth dynamics in the developed world. So I am glad there is inflationary pressure. Having said that inflation is going to be coming off in India for the rest of this year which means that concern should recede. The central bank will continue to tighten incrementally. I think that\u2019s sensible given the external environment, but I think incremental tightening that the RBI is doing is enough to upset stocks here unduly.Bank credit growth. This I think is a very important chart. The Indian banking sector is a capitalist banking system unlike the Chinese system. So when the economies slow, the banks slow their lending whereas in China they were ordered to lend more. Now the credit cycle is picking up again, that\u2019s a very healthy development. We are looking at about 20% loan growth in India this year. But I think the most important positive points of all is that the credit cycle is being led by infrastructure loans, not personal loans, as you can see from this chart. This raises the key point which in my view is the critical bearable for the Indian macroeconomic story this year and for the next 5 to 10 years is whether we can get an infrastructure cycle playing out.The fact that infrastructure loans are leading the credit cycle is anecdotal evidence that is happening. If we get infrastructure happening in India, it\u2019s quite possible that India can grow at 9% plus a year for the next 5 years at least, if not 10 years, which means that India in my view is going to be growing more rapidly than China. In my view a more basic trend growth in China is going to be 8% and that\u2019s a growth rate that Chinese Communist party is going to be comfortable with. So the higher growth rate in India than in China, if the infrastructure story happens, is going to raise the profile of the Indian story globally.Clearly if I am wrong and infrastructure does not happen in India, the whole Indian story becomes much less interesting. It\u2019s not a disaster, but the country only grows just 5%-6%. So this is fixed investment relative to GDP in India. I am expecting this line to pick up again. Car sales, two-wheelers sales are going up. So the consumer story is still perfectly good story in India. It has picked up with the monetary easing, but as I say the key variable for me is infrastructure.In terms of risks to the Indian markets, probably the biggest risk to the Indian market is simply the huge amount of foreign money. My own guess is that the next time there is a global hiccup, foreigners will sell India less aggressively than in 2008 for the simple reason that India has shown it can decouple from the US economic cycle.The other point is the fact that foreign investors stay much in India is basically confirmation that India is a good story and those foreign investors who have not yet invested in India are all desperately waiting for a correction. So they can invest, that\u2019s the mindset of them.One year forward price to book. India is not cheap, but it\u2019s not expensive in the context of Indian stock market history and in my view the Indian stock market will continue to trade at a premium to Asian and mother of emerging markets because the Indian market is like one big growth stock and growth stocks trade at a premium. Clearly, if you want to enter in an equity portfolio for dividends & you don\u2019t buy India, then you should go and look at Singapore.This chart perceives a useful chart for anybody who is trying to raise Indian funds in the room because it shows a huge outperformance of India - MSCI India relative to MSCI China in recent history. I will just end with the 3 charts on Japan & the reason I am doing this is because of my experience when I lived in Japan in the early 90s and the experience of Japan in the last 20 years is a potential lead indicator of what is going to happen in the West."], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}

These days every conversation begins with the P/E ratio (price to earning ratio, which compares the current price of the share with its per share earnings) and ends with a loud proclamation that the valuations look \u2018a bit stretched.\u2019However, many experts believe that looking at a ratio in isolation won\u2019t help investors grasp the realities of the market and a higher valuation may not be the only deciding factor driving the market.\u2018\u2018Valuations matter in the long run, but it need not have an impact in the short run. This is because there is never a right valuation for a stock, as it is a highly individual call,\u2019\u2019 says Mukesh Dedhia, director, Ghalla & Bhansali Securities.\u2018\u2018For example, a stock with a higher P/E may be moving ahead further as there is greater demand for the stock because of its higher earnings possibility. So, there is always a bit of confusion about the right valuation,\u2019\u2019 he adds.\u2018\u2018If you look at the broader market, it is difficult to get a value pick. But if you are doing a bottom up method, you would still find many stocks in the market with the right valuation,\u2019\u2019 says Rajiv Thakkar, CEO, Parag Parikh Financial Advisory Services. Though he is a firm believer of value investing, he says looking at a ratio alone won\u2019t be the right way to investing in a stock.\u2018\u2018There are many things you have to consider. For example, you have to find out whether the growth rate is sustainable or how much capital is required to keep the growth. Sometimes, there would be volume growth, but the margins could be under pressure. There are a host of issues to consider, just looking at a ratio is not enough,\u2019\u2019 he adds.Some experts also believe that the higher valuations could be justified if foreign investors continue to pump money into the stock market with the hope of better performance by Indian companies.\u2018\u2018The current valuations doesn\u2019t justify the long term growth potential of India.

While a weakening rupee might bring cheer to export-oriented sectors such as IT and textiles, it has pushed up the foreign exchange liabilities of Indian companies.\n\nAccounting rules, called AS-11 provisions, make it mandatory for companies to make mark-to-market provisions in their profit & loss accounts for any changes in foreign currency loans. The worst hit have been those companies that predominantly serve the domestic market and opted for foreign currency loans to finance their growth plans.\n\nAccording to an analysis by ETIG, the profitability of companies will be dented by mark to market (MTM) losses. Tata Steel may report a forex loss of around Rs 344 crore, whereas Tata Motors could take a hit of Rs 311 crore. Tata Chemicals, which took a foreign currency loan of $475 million to fund its overseas acquisitions, is estimated to report a forex loss of Rs 187 crore. Ranbaxy, JSW Steel and Firstsource Solutions will lose Rs 100 crore and Rs 400 crore each.

The rupee had positively impacted most of the above companies till last year, but it has depreciated by over 9% in the quarter ended September 2008.\n\nWhen the rupee depreciates, the value of foreign currency liability denominated in rupee terms increases and vice versa. According to AS-11 stipulations, an increase in liability should be reflected in the quarterly profit and loss statement and will translate into lower corporate profits. Most companies are focused on the domestic market and are therefore unlikely to benefit from a weakening rupee.\n\nThe falling rupee will severely affect the small companies, whereas the big ones will be impacted only moderately. Firstsource Solutions may report a net loss, while Tata Steel might see a 100 basis points decline in net profit margin on account of forex losses. To put things in perspective, most companies will experience a 10-50% hit on their operating profits.\n\nCompanies such as Reliance Communication, Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel follow schedule-VI of the Companies Act, instead of AS-11 and are therefore unlikely to see an impact on their quarterly profit and loss statements.

Having sought refreshment at the Governor's Ball, the team who won five of Sunday's Academy Awards - including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor - adjourned to a packed party hosted by their film's distributor, Harvey Weinstein , at the Mondrian Hotel in Hollywood.Then they swept through Vanity Fair's bash, before continuing to the Chateau Marmont hotel, where at around four in the morning, several boisterous members of their entourage leapt into the swimming pool, fully clothed.The second post-Oscar question requires even more careful consideration.

{"Delhi World Book fair: A fair like no other": [["Delhi World Book fair: A fair like no other", "In Delhi it's that time of year again when publishers, distributors and retailers are scrambling around frantically getting everything from point-of-sale to stocks right. It's the World Book fair (WBF), which comes around once every two years sprawling across the giant halls of Pragati Maidan. This is the fair's 20th edition, and although there are look-alikes all over the country, this one is undoubtedly the mother-of-them all.In the 1980s and the '90s, the Kolkata Book fair was the fair to go. But with the move from the maidan, apart from other venue and organisational problems, Kolkata has had to give up its title. Today the Delhi WBF is a mammoth affair, and has gone beyond just being a sort of retail exhibition.Actually, no book fair in India would really qualify to be a 'trade fair' like Frankfurt or London, where business and rights deals are a norm. But like the Jaipur Literary Fest, what we lack in focus, or 'order and method', we make up for in sheer numbers.The WBF is a giant carnival. The last edition had over 800,000 visitors, and the organizers are wondering whether this year the million mark will be touched, given that the Pragati Maidan now has direct metro connectivity and that admission is free. Certainly the exhibitors have gone up since last time to about 1,300. That's still, of course, less than a tenth of the total number of publishers in the country, as estimated by the various federations who put the count at being well over 15,000.This year, for the first time, the dates of the WBF moved from the traditional January end to early February period to a whole month down the line. This has met with some consternation as many publishers felt that it was leaving it too late for library budgets, and many schools would have exams on, and that might affect the turnout a bit. The jury is out on that one - the verdict will be out on the 4th of March when it all gets over.So what are the business stats from the fair? Herein lies the rub - there are none. Ironically, for an industry that is seeing technological change at a pace like never before, and typically of an industry still coming to grips with management information, there is no reliable data available apart from guesstimates.The National Book Trust (NBT) - the fair organizers - blames it on traditional publisher mindsets and the archaic notion of 'business secrets' where exhibitors don't divulge figures. But even just by conservative extrapolation, assuming a Rs 2.5 lakh average turnover per participant (incidentally, the big ones top Rs 20 crore) one is looking at a fair turnover of over Rs 30 crore in cash sales, which is more than three times the business done from all of the leading bookstores all over India in any given week. Trade buying, rights deals, subscription sales, print contracts, and other 'collateral business' are on top of this.The WBF - indeed the industry - needs to take this to the next level with a dedicated two days for 'trade and rights'. Years ago, the first two hours of the fair every day used to be designated trade hours where librarians and stockists could browse uninterrupted, a practice since discontinued. But if the 9-day fair could be shortened to seven days for consumers with two days as business days, India might yet see the fillip it needs in its rights business, as local-to-international rights networks build.India has a large contingent going to Frankfurt but bulk of these is either English publishers-distributors, visiting principals or remainder merchants buying surplus stock. The size of the Indian rights pavilion is testament to the fact that our share of the rights pie is negligible.When were the last time you heard of an Indian work in translation break out through a rights purchase the way Wolf-Totem was snapped up from Chinese or The Devotion of Suspect-X from the Japanese? It's only if we build a rights module here within the WBF, that one can gradually work up (yes it will take years) to exploiting the rights potential from Indian languages in translation.So what purpose does the fair serve? With the surge in online bookstores, does it still have any relevance? I believe it still has huge relevance. Quite simply it is at its most fundamental, the only real direct interface publishers have with their end readers. This is the only time you can actually put the range you want up there, and watch readers as they browse.For most publishers, the long tedious day playing floor assistant and traffic cop rolled into one has its reward in watching that die-hard fan chasing that obscure book you thought would never sell. The ecstasy of finding that long lost book, the agony of seeing something priced beyond one's budget, the amazement at seeing a bargain or combo offer...it's all there every day, hour on hour. For readers, this is the one time you'll get to see, touch, browse lists and full range as you can never anywhere else.Online has its convenience, but by and large you need to know what book you want, notwithstanding the cross recommendations the better sites have. This is where a reader can experience that joy of discovery-where s/he will see full series, obscure imprints, rare titles.Then there are the bargains. Fair rules make it impossible to deep discount but bargain tables with 'fair prices' and combination offers abound. What we have over the nine days of the fair is in essence the world's largest bookstore-over a million square feet of books to choose from-in every Indian language, a lot of foreign ones, and of course English.(The author is Managing Director, Hachette India)"], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}

{"Every decision of government needn\u2019t be a big reform: Anand Mahindra": [["Every decision of government needn\u2019t be a big reform: Anand Mahindra", "Anand Mahindra can\u2019t wait to get back home from the US because all the action is happening in India with a new, stable government led by Narendra Modi in place. Hours after chairing a board meeting of Mahindra & Mahindra at midnight US time, the company\u2019s chairman and MD spoke on Saturday to Satish John at length from Boston on his hopes and aspirations for the country. The new administration has begun well and a lot more is expected from it, he said. Excerpts:I think it is almost brilliant to put at the head of the list the fact that bureaucrats should be encouraged to take decisions without fear. In a sense he\u2019s gone to the heart of the problem of the paralysis. The Indian government is extraordinarily large and it is difficult to try and believe that one leader can make all the change. This is a federal system. In a large bureaucracy you cannot exercise the transformation of any situation without coopting bureaucracy.So empowerment becomes important. It\u2019s a good sign. If you remember, one of the major apprehensions about Modi was an autocratic style of functioning. By putting right at the top of the agenda the empowerment of the bureaucracy I think one has to appreciate and admit that it is definitely not the act of an autocrat.Without making much heavy weather of it, he\u2019s been a case study for business schools on how to exercise leadership and have an impact from day one in the new job. He\u2019s setting a clear agenda and is making a clear promise of making a measurement of progress made against that clear agenda. For example, making an agenda for 100 days will make it clear what the matrix would be for measuring success of that agenda. It is important that every day some incremental progress is made towards that agenda and that progress is communicated transparently. He has got his team ready, which is a focused team. To me, every decision needn\u2019t be a big-bang reform but a signal of proactive decision-making and removal of red tape and bureaucracy. And a promise of even speedier decision-making in the future.Back in the 1980s, I had written a column headlined \u2018Roads to Nowhere\u2019. At that time we were not building enough roads. (Among) America\u2019s competitive advantages happen to be its highways and its transportation network. Those are like blood vessels to the economy and they create job opportunities. Therefore, in a funny sense, the best thing anyone can do to create an inclusive economy is ironically through building roads, because access to markets or the lack of access to markets is one of the most discriminatory things one can do to the poor, especially to the rural poor. It\u2019s not a point that we automatically think of but roads are a mechanism to create inclusiveness in the economy. So, I think, the faster he does that the better for the economy. There is huge economic data to show that roads (give) a bigger boost to rural income than even irrigation. It will help power dual income for families and will allow a kind of diversity from dependence on agriculture which creates productivity.I\u2019ve been here (in the US) for quite a while now. The Indian elections have generated enormous interest. Most of the diplomatic and political pundits are now urging the leadership in Washington not to miss out on what they feel is the diplomatic opportunity for the US in reaching out to and rebuilding a very strong relationship with India. They feel US has lost ground because of the visa controversy and that they should now rediscover the ground and build a strong relationship.There is a feeling that both Japan and China have both stolen a march on building this kind of relationship with India. There is going to be, in my opinion, a strong effort from decision-makers here to reach out to the prime minister and his colleagues to rebuild the relationship.There has been significant interest shown by Japan. It is a country with a liquidity overhang and an investment surplus. Modi is well aware of that. Why Japanese investors have been holding back is because they did not perceive any of the promises we\u2019ve given to be gaining traction.In the area of construction and large industrial projects, they can take pole position in large projects here. That being said, everybody speculated what the position of the PM and the Cabinet would be and the PM is his own man. My contention is that our PM is a practical man and he knows that any kind of vindictiveness has no role in foreign policy.I think his whole objective is to enhance India\u2019s economic health and through that gain what should be India\u2019s rightful role in the world. The fact that we are the world\u2019s largest democracy and we are all aware that power and a role in global affairs for a nation comes from economic strength. I think, in his own way and at the right time, he will respond positively when the correct signals are sent out from the US administration.We have been consistent from the time we entered into JVs with foreign companies. We have not changed our stance. Right from the beginning we have been representing to the government that it is a positive step to allow at least 49% investment through the automatic route. Because it encourages the foreign partner to deploy the technology into the JV. Otherwise, there is wariness on their part to provide 100% support to the joint venture. So if you really want the best technology to be manufactured here, then (it should be) a minimum of 49% stake, which we have always advocated.We have never shied away from making investments. Even during downcycles, we never stopped our investments. We invested in the Chakan automotive plant when the economy was down; we also invested in the tractor plant in Zaheerabad when the tractor market was witnessing a downcycle. When the market improved for tractors we were able to ramp up our output. We always have a long-term view of the economy. We have consistently been investing. In defence, for example, if the government starts buying again for the much-needed upgrade then we\u2019ll certainly make the investments. Pawan (Goenka) has gone on record to say that we are considering a Rs 4,000-crore investment, which is independent of the new developments.

In fact, Ambassador Joao Cravinho , head of the EU delegation, led Ambassadors of various European countries to a quiet lunch with Modi at the capital last year. And in the runup to the polls, he even travelled across India to get a sense of the probable outcome and interacted with all players cutting across the political spectrum, something foreign envoys seldom do. In an interview with ET, Ambassador Cravinho described India\u2019s new Prime Minister as a man with clarity of thought who has a clear vision for India and governance. The Ambassador feels that EU member states have the potential to drive Modi\u2019s economic diplomacy and help boost India\u2019s economic health.We want India to do well. This election has ensured that there\u2019s political stability for the next five years. A decisive leadership would mean tougher decisions, and no good governance is possible without tough decisions. The BJP-led NDA has a clear mandate to take bold and innovative decisions. International politics is not about zero-sum game and while India would economically engage other powers, EU has the potential to drive growth in India. EU is already the single biggest trading partner as a bloc, and is the single largest source of FDI for India as a bloc. We are ready to meet India\u2019s needs in the fields of technology and funds.As a former Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Portugal, I had interacted with various leaders worldwide and I can say that Mr Modi is among the best. He has clarity of thought and clear vision of governance and that\u2019s what India requires. He also has a very clear understanding of the challenges before the country. He is a good listener as well as a good talker and can engage in enriching discussions. No Prime Minister would like to have communal strife on his record, and I am certain that he would not allow any communal tensions in India. His priority is to boost the economy and he has his eyes set on that.Negotiators from India and European Union are on the job to conclude the FTA. The proposed agreement will lead to greater openness. In the past, EU held discussions with the BJP on the FTA. We take Mr Modi\u2019s speech on economic issues on February 27 as a positive.

Now you have a leader who has a known bias for fixing things and making sure that things work. It is the same set of structure, the same set of people who are driving this. You have the right leader who can drive the effort.The first sense comes from the market. It is the collective wisdom of the marketplace that there is action and we will move with speed. That improves the confidence level of industry. Now we need to see whether some of the ground conditions that are needed for people to get back to an investment mode are going to change. Today I read that with a large slate of reforms or projects which have been stuck are going to be addressed in the next few days. If that happens, you will see a sea change in the investment mindset, as it were.I think that between three and six months it could start happening. But we want incremental investment to happen. There is enough to harvest in the first six months in terms of stuck projects and so on.I do not want to call or second-guess what somebody is working on. But I think it will be a budget where you try to have fiscal discipline and whatever is needed to get that discipline. Now in what measure, in what combination, is for the government to call. I think one thing that people will look for in the budget is fiscal discipline and a way to getting the deficit under control, say, over a three-year period. If it is well-constructed and well-articulated, you will see the cheer going up.If you eliminate waste, you eliminate what is theft and eliminate what is not needed, the 4.1 is achievable.Regarding the monetary policy, we always say that let us see the constructive design of a fiscal deficit. We know what it is and where it will end. Once they see that construct as it were, for this year and, say, for two years on the line, then I should believe that they should have greater confidence to tinker with the rates, or inflation itself has to start dropping. We see several people have given several solutions starting with release food stocks, pushing the pedal on APMC reform, and so on. I am sure again this is something that the government will very quickly understand and take all the steps or some of the steps which would give policymakers confidence to get interest rates down. We should see it happen in this fiscal, in the next 12 months. I think it ought to start happening in the first six months.I have no call on this. Let us see what happens. Everything will depend on where the deficit number comes in and whether you are able to get the inflation rate moving down. If these turn out positive, rates could move fast.My long-term number does not have a single digit. It is two digits. So you can make a guess on it.I think it will happen during the term of this government.It will happen in the first term of this government. That is for sure. If they progress the way they mean to, I am reasonably sure that we will see two-digit rate in the first term of this government itself."], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}

So, there are many things that are still not in Modi\u2019s hands, says Raamdeo Agrawal, Joint Managing Director, Motilal Oswal Financial Services in an interview with Narendra Nathan and Sanket Dhanorkar.\n\n\n\nAre we looking at a multi-year bull run?\n\n\n\nI think the market has not yet priced in the full potential of the economy. For the first time, a true nationalist has come to power with a clear majority. There is a new-found energy across the nation. My sense is that the market has not yet understood the difference between 300-plus seats for NDA and 272-plus seats for BJP alone. Look at how the cabinet posts have been assigned \u2014 BJP allies have got limited posts and their negotiating power is diminished. Complete power is in the hands of the government. The political scenario is drastically different now. The economy is on the cusp of a historical positive change.\n\n\n\nIt is the same vehicle, but the driver has changed. It is now being steered by a formula-one driver. So, the acceleration will be dramatic. It will become visible very quickly. Today we are growing at 4.5 per cent. Growth is likely to pick up pace rapidly in the next few years. A lot of things will happen in five years. It will be interesting to see the index level at that time. In the process, investors will make tons of money, because the market will discount that growth two years in advance. It will not wait for the fifth year. If all domestic and global factors align, markets will go through the roof.\n\n\n\nAre there challenges to the fragile economic recovery?\n\n\n\nThe current optimism is because a major variable \u2014 the shambolic political setup \u2014 has been corrected. There is no doubt that the new government has been fully empowered in this election; the mandate has been given to an extremely competent individual. Right now, everybody is bullish. But one must have tempered expectations. Finally, directives from the Centre have to be executed well at the state level. Otherwise it will be a waste. There are many things that are still not in Modi\u2019s hands.\n\n\n\nA lot of other factors will also play a role. Good monsoons, favourable global environment, peaceful borders, etc., can change the entire scenario. But, only time will tell how many stars will align. So, a lot will depend on external factors. I am also keenly watching how the new government tackles inflation, which is just a symptom of a much deeper problem somewhere else. The government has to address supply-side bottlenecks. A weak currency cannot make a strong country. That is why, inflation must go down. It will be the beginning of development, investments, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe rally, so far, has been driven by hope. When will fundamentals take over?\n\n\n\nNews headlines, and making money are two entirely different things. We should not get carried away by the headlines. The focus must be on who will actually make money. In most cases, it will be a company which is making money right now. Very rarely will a company that is broke today make money tomorrow, unless there is a complete change in business dynamics. Today, we do not have anything to go by. So, wherever there are anomalies in the economy, these will come back to normal levels. Right now, it is only about the promise of a better tomorrow. Some of these promises will have to take shape in the budget.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat should be the first priority for the new government?\n\n\n\nIndia has to become much more business friendly. Finally, the country needs to create jobs for its rising young population. Who will create these jobs? More than the government, it is the businesses which will create jobs. Businesses can create jobs only if the business environment is friendly. They also cannot sustain growth without creating jobs. So, the government has to become business friendly. All hurdles should be removed. We need businesses to take more risks as it will result in more jobs.\n\n\n\nWill mid-cap stocks continue to perform better than large-caps for now?\n\n\n\nIt really depends on the company. Mid-caps were lagging for quite some time; smallcaps even more. Eventually it has to converge. Large-caps are now looking highly priced. Investor appetite is limited at these levels. Most of the action is in the low-quality, low-priced segment. Smaller investors are clearly buying low-quality stuff, thinking that the price is low. But, even if it moves into high valuation territory, low quality will remain so. This is where the entire game ends. Sure, high quality stocks are expensive now. But that doesn\u2019t mean you should have junk in your portfolio. If you find quality at a reasonable price, buy with modest expectations. Such names are few and far between. But, even if you get 3-4 such ideas over one year, you can make money. The challenge is to have patience and hold on to the investment. Filling with junk will be a disaster, but if it works, you get a multi-bagger. Investors in high quality may underperform in a rallying market, but will emerge better off over an entire cycle.\n\n\n\nCan we expect an earnings upgrade anytime soon?\n\n\n\nA 12-15 per cent earnings upgrade is definitely possible this year. As the economy recovers, sectors, such as cement, steel and automobiles, will pick up pace. Oil & gas can also contribute to earnings growth. Right now corporate profits are contributing around 4 per cent to the GDP, which is near the bottom of the band. At the peak of a cycle, this can go upto 7-8 per cent. Assuming 13-14 per cent nominal growth in GDP, it will double in rupee term to Rs 220 trillion in next six years. Now the question is whether the current profit of Rs 4 trillion will move up to Rs 8 trillion or Rs 16 trillion. If it maintains the current ratio, it will go to Rs 8 trillion. If it touches the upper end of the band, it will go to Rs 16 trillion. If this happens and the PE multiple remains the same, the market will go up four times. Profits will zoom the moment the economy moves from 5-6 per cent to 8-9 per cent growth. That is why there is a potential for the market to go up to the stratospheric levels from here."], "Economic_Times", "10/27/2020, 13:19:09"]}

{"There is a leadership vacuum in Infosys, time to get Nandan Nilekani back: Mohandas Pai": [["There is a leadership vacuum in Infosys, time to get Nandan Nilekani back: Mohandas Pai", "There is a leadership vacuum in the company, because they made the wrong choice of CEO three years ago and that is playing out right now. The company has not performed and in June 2011, they had appointed three members on the board and all three of them have gone now and all three have been extraordinary individuals. Ashok Vemuri is now the CEO of another company, V Balakrishnan had left and has started his own fund and BG Srinivas, I am told, would now be joining some other company as CEO.So obviously, all three have been CEO materials. It is obvious that the chemistry did not work, or they were not fully empowered. There is a need for the board to sit down and work out a good succession plan and put a new team in place because the entire layer of people below the executive board are now gone and many of them were outstanding performers.Yes, a few of them possibly were not pulling the weight, but it is not possible that all of them were not doing so. They were extraordinary people and they are performing at other places.So there is a need for teamwork and need for people to come together. They need to forget the past and focus on the future, they need to realign the company based upon what the market needs.The market has changed and so its model needs to change, its management structure needs to change and the set of people who have ruled the company for 30 years have to step down and hand over reins, because they have stayed on for too long. Therefore, I hope that in the next one or two months, the board will come together along with NRN and once and for all close this issue.My view is that the layer below BG Srinivas, V Balakrishnan and Ashok Vemuri is an extraordinary layer. You have many good people who have run units. But they have run units and they require one or two years to come up with enterprise.Enterprise position is very different from a unit position. You could be an extraordinary unit person, but to run an entire enterprise in a very competitive environment, you require some mentoring and some experience.Now the entire generation of leaders who could have handled enterprise has gone. The next layer of people have done very well and there is great management there, but they need to connect between themselves and NRN who is the executive chairman and will stay for the next three years. That connect has to be fixed and it is up to NRN to do it.Now it can be done by somebody stepping up to the plate as CEO. He will be inexperienced, he would not have handled enterprise, but being very efficient, in three to six months, he can pick it up.However, that requires a different style of functioning by NRN. It also means that some amount of bloodletting will happen. In fact, it has to happen when the next generation comes up, because obviously people who are much senior will not stay on and there has to be a cleanup.

In the earlier days, they used to read books, but now they read small, short writeups on the Net. Life has become faster after all, where is the time for reading a few-hundred-page book. I can get it all in a two-page writeup with two illustrations thrown in. And if I read about five such, hell, I am already well educated or indeed, well read!The problem with both the above sets \u2013 who are setting out to become traders, mind you \u2013 is that they are doing what is deemed \u2018necessary action\u2019 but without any understanding. The focus is on getting to the bottom line. This is so much like us, in real life, during some puja or undertaking some fast or attending a temple or church or mosque.We all go through the motions, because that is what we think is the deal. We all go through rituals of offering flowers or candles or chaddars and believe that we have done our bit. And if we don\u2019t do all these things, we feel guilty about it. We are even made to feel guilty about it by those around us, whether elder or younger.This is the classic case of ritualistic practice. Unless philosophy behind the rituals is known, this breeds superstition. Interpreters of Holy books will warn us of dire consequences in the here, as well as hereafter, if we don\u2019t \u2018DO\u2019 some things in some ways.Quite in the same way, traders also become superstitious. Some of them have ridiculous rituals that they believe is necessary for them to win. Some of them go to extreme lengths to avoid doing something in order not to lose. A typical translation of this in trading action is taking profits early or avoiding taking a loss.Understanding the method means understanding price action . How many people really spend time in a training programme, trying to understand basic price action? What is a trend? Why is there a congestion? Why should prices pull back? Why does a trendline work? What is the relevance of Fibonacci retracement and why does it work? Is there a reason the Bollinger should wax and wane and, if so, do I know it?Alas! I find too many of today\u2019s leaners of stock technicals more interested in the bottom line, or the last line, than concentrating on burnishing their basics. They all want to be PhDs without wanting to go through their school or college graduation. They think school learning with a casual look at a PhD book or its pr\u00e9cis on the Net is sufficient to keep their education current.They feel they can discard much of the basics of price action analysis in favour of a few, explicable, computer-driven methods and expect to get great results. They will, from time to time. But long-term success? No chance.Price action lies at the root of all success in markets. Whether your approach is technical or fundamental, it does not matter any bit. If you do not invest your time in understanding market price behaviour, and continue to invest it every single day, the market will beat you every day, every year.Return to your basics at every chance you get and re-learn them many times over.
