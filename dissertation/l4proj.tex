\title{HotOrNot: Tracking company attractiveness and profitability from news streams}

%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}

    \vskip 0.5em
    Analyzing the sentiments expressed in articles could help to predict the current and future attractiveness of companies. The goal of this project was to create a tool to aid financial investors through collecting and analyzing article's sentiments to predict the current attractiveness of a company and award a \textit{Hot} or \textit{Not} verdict.
    
    For this project, a system was developed that could; gather articles, perform sentence extraction on those articles, identify companies being discussed in sentences and articles, award sentiment scores to sentences, use sentence sentiment to predict future stock prices, award a \textit{Hot} or \textit{Not} verdict and display the results to users.
    
    The system's key components were evaluated to both improve the performance of the individual components and the overall system. A user study evaluated the frontend system, with participants agreeing it was simple and easy to use. Future work on the project would involve deploying the web app and adding additional features or improving upon existing ones.

%==============================================================================
%% Notes on formatting
%==============================================================================
% The first page, abstract and table of contents are numbered using Roman numerals and are not
% included in the page count. 
%
% From now on pages are numbered
% using Arabic numerals. Therefore, immediately after the first call to \chapter we need the call
% \pagenumbering{arabic} and this should be called once only in the document. 
%
% Do not alter the bibliography style.
%
% The first Chapter should then be on page 1. You are allowed 40 pages for a 40 credit project and 30 pages for a 
% 20 credit report. This includes everything numbered in Arabic numerals (excluding front matter) up
% to but excluding the appendices and bibliography.
%
% You must not alter text size (it is currently 10pt) or alter margins or spacing.
%
%
%==================================================================================================================================
%
% IMPORTANT
% The chapter headings here are **suggestions**. You don't have to follow this model if
% it doesn't fit your project. Every project should have an introduction and conclusion,
% however.

%\chapter{Appendices}

%Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
%\item
%  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
%\item
%  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
%  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

%\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

%\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

%\end{itemize}

%\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
%submitted separately.

\chapter{System Usability Scale}
\label{Ap:SUS}

\section{Questions}

The system usability scale consists of ten question. Users are asked to assign a score to each question from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). The questions are the following: 
\begin{enumerate}
                \item I think that I would like to use this system frequently.
                \item I found the system unnecessarily complex.
                \item I thought the system was easy to use.
                \item I think that I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this system.
                \item I found the various functions in this system were well integrated.
                \item I thought there was too much inconsistency in this system.
                \item I would imagine that most people would learn to use this system very quickly.
                \item I found the system very cumbersome to use.
                \item I felt very confident using the system.
                \item I needed to learn a lot of things before I could get going with this system.	
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Guide to Running}
Running the system is straightforward with the steps detailed below and on the project's github found here: \url{https://github.com/2312420/lvl4-project}

\begin{itemize}
    \item cd into src
    \item run docker-compose build
    \item run docker-compose up
    \item Webapp should be running at "http://127.0.0.1:8000/hotornot/"
