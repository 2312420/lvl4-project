    abstract={Sentiment analysis research has been increasing tremendously in recent times due to the wide range of business and social applications. Sentiment analysis from unstructured natural language text has recently received considerable attention from the research community. In this paper, we propose a novel sentiment analysis model based on common-sense knowledge extracted from ConceptNet based ontology and context information. ConceptNet based ontology is used to determine the domain specific concepts which in turn produced the domain specific important features. Further, the polarities of the extracted concepts are determined using the contextual polarity lexicon which we developed by considering the context information of a word. Finally, semantic orientations of domain specific features of the review document are aggregated based on the importance of a feature with respect to the domain. The importance of the feature is determined by the depth of the feature in the ontology. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

abstract = {Stock market price data is generated in huge volume and it changes every second. Stock market is a complex and challenging system where people will either gain money or lose their entire life savings. In this work, an attempt is made for prediction of stock market trend. Two models are built one for daily prediction and the other one is for monthly prediction. Supervised machine learning algorithms are used to build the models. As part of the daily prediction model, historical prices are combined with sentiments. Up to 70 of accuracy is observed using supervised machine learning algorithms on daily prediction model. Monthly prediction model tries to evaluate whether there is any similarity between any two months trend. Evaluation proves that trend of one month is least correlated with the trend of another month.}

abstract = {Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an information extraction task aimed at identifying and classifying words of a sentence, a paragraph or a document into predefined categories of Named Entities (NEs). NEs are terms that are used to name a person, location or organization. They are also used to refer to the value or amount of something. NER is an important tool in almost all NLP application areas out of which it is very essential in Search Engines (Semantic based), Machine Translation, Question-Answering, Indexing for Information Retrieval and Automatic Summarization systems. A lot of NER researches have been conducted and systems have been developed for a resource rich European and Asian languages. This book proposes and presents the development of NER system for Afan Oromo, a language that has the largest native speakers in Ethiopia. The algorithms and techniques presented in this study have shown good performance thereby reflecting how NER system can be developed for a resource scarce languages.}
